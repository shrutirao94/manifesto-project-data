PLATEFORME ELECTORALE PARTI VERT 2015,NA
BUILDING A CANADA THAT WORKS.,NA
TOGETHER 2015,NA
"AT HEART, I AM AN OPTIMIST.    Though my job constantly requires me to look to the challenges and dangers on the horizon, I know that Canadians working together can solve any problem, overcome any hurdle. I think that is what makes us Canadian a profound faith that together, through hard work, compassion and cooperation, we can build a better future.   This platform is about Canada. Our democracy, our economy, our communities our future. This platform is about people, each and every one of us, and the role we play in our country and the essential services we all need to live safe, happy, fulfilled, and enriched lives.    I know many may think of the Green Party as a single issue party yet, nothing could be further from the truth. Granted, you know me as someone who for the past forty years has stood firm to protect the air we all breathe, the water we drink, and the land that sustains us. But you also know me as a staunch defender of democracy, of economic policies that make sense, of fairness and openness, of justice and equity.   Have a look at what we are proposing to build a Canada that works together, but don't stop there. Ask the tough questions of how we will work in the next parliament in collaboration with all parties to do what's best for Canadians and our country. Then ask the other leaders those same tough questions. You deserve answers promises are just not good enough.   Our platform is organized around four key issue areas: economy, communities, government, and climate. The policies within have been developed democratically, by people from all walks of Canadian life, from every province, territory, and traditional land.  Canadians inspire me. As Leader of the Green Party, I want to work for citizens to be heard. I want to work to help people who need help, and support small business and local communities as we grow stronger. Canadians in this election, more than ever, can vote from hope and from conviction, not from fear. In this platform you will find optimism, confidence, and sensible Canadian-made plans for a better future.    I hope they inspire you to join us, and to vote Green on October 19.   Elizabeth May Leader,   Green Party of Canada",NA
BUILDING A CANADA THAT WORKS TOGETHER,NA
"OUR VISION FOR A STRONG, SECURE AND SUSTAINABLE CANADA",NA
"In a world filled with conflict and uncertainty, Canada stands as an island of peace, freedom, and stability.",601
"Canadians are a people united by cooperation, hard work, and mutual respect.",606
"We know that it is our families, our communities, and our teamwork that make us strong.",606
"We view the diversity of our nation not as a liability, but rather as a shared strength and source of pride.",607
"Together, we have built one of the wealthiest countries in the world, blessed with a skilled and resourceful population, abundant natural resources, and a highly productive economy.",601
"We have built a country with universal health care, public education, a social safety net that safeguards us in times of hardship, and a public pension plan that provides us security in retirement.",601
"But, in recent years, the national values, natural environment, and individual qualities that allowed us to build the Canada we know and love have come under threat.",601
"The Harper Conservatives have skewed and weakened the Canadian economy, focusing solely on higher polluting industries, instead of on creating good, stable, high-paying jobs.",305
"They have failed our communities by slashing funding to critical public services, instead subsidizing foreign multinational corporations and providing tax cuts to the wealthiest few.",305
They have granted special privileges to foreign corporations and made us subservient to the interests of foreign investors.,305
"They have failed to unite us in the face of conflict and uncertainty, instead cynically opting to divide our nation for partisan gain.",305
"They have failed to act in the face of an ever-growing climate crisis, instead gambling our future on more pipelines, more fracking, and risky tankers on our coasts.",305
"This platform lays out a plan to move Canada forward, to overcome the last ten years, and restore the shared values and principles that built the country we love.",305
"Our economic plan invests in people and creates good jobs, focusing on skills, knowledge, and sustainable resource development.",416
"Our plan envisions strong communities as the foundation of a strong country,",606
"and will provide the investments in infrastructure,",411
"education,",506
and health care necessary to make that vision a reality.,504
"Our plan proposes democratic reforms that will make our politicians more accountable,",202
"our parliament more accessible,",202
and our voting system more representatives.,202
"Our plan takes bold climate action, by embracing the solutions that we already know work,",501
"encouraging research into those we have yet to discover,",411
and increasing the taxes paid by corporate polluters.,501
"We understand that in a federation like Canada, no one level of government and no one political party has all the answers.",301
Canada stands apart from every other industrialized country in lacking any national goals or strategy to respond to pressing issues.,301
"We are the only country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with no national policy for energy, housing, education, transportation, health care, climate, or culture.",301
We need to reinvent the way we make decisions.,301
Greens will press for the creation of a Council of Canadian Governments.,301
"Building on the First Ministers' Conference (a body ignored by Stephen Harper), we will convene a council comprised of federal, provincial-territorial, municipal-local, as well as First Nations, Mtis and Inuit leaders.",301
"Gathered around the same table, national goals will be developed, publicly and transparently.",301
Each level of government will then implement that part of the plan within its jurisdiction.,301
Policy alignment will ensure the wise use of public dollars.,301
"All levels of government, pulling in the same direction, will put Canada on the path to a prosperous, sustainable future built on fairness and justice.",301
"Green Members of Parliament, united by this vision for Canada, will be your local champions in Ottawa working on behalf of you, your family, and your community.",305
It's time to build a Canada that works.,305
Together.,305
SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY - BECAUSE TOMORROW IS SERIOUS BUSINESS,NA
Canada is teetering on a recession for the second time since Stephen Harper became prime minister.,305
"His ill-advised political pledge to eliminate the deficit he created, just in time for this election, is now risking a deepening recession.",305
"Despite Conservative mismanagement, our economic fundamentals remain sound. We have the technology, we have the people, and we have the resources.",408
We are one of the wealthiest nations in the world in every sense of the word.,408
"Today, our economy produces 50 percent more wealth per capita than it did a generation ago.",408
"Nevertheless, Canadians are feeling more squeezed economically than ever before.",408
"Despite a shift to two-income households, the current generation of young families faces increasing costs for housing, education, and childcare, and unprecedented household debt.",408
"For the first time in our history, older Canadians are saying that their children will not enjoy the same standard of living as they did at the same age.",408
"Meanwhile, our political leaders repeat the mantra that government cupboards are bare.",408
Deep cuts in the tax rate for large corporations have led to a hoarding of cash in big business bank accounts.,408
The former Governor of the Bank of Canada called it dead money€ and there's a lot of it.,408
"Over $600 billion, equivalent to 32 percent of our GDP, is held in corporate bank accounts not being re-invested, not working at all.",408
Dead money.,408
"Old-line parties have ignored places to fund needed programs and instead claim there is no new money for health care services, education, pensions, infrastructure, public safety, or scientific research.",408
There is a serious disconnect between the unprecedented wealth produced by the Canadian economy and the increasing economic insecurity of Canadians.,408
We must take decisive action to build a sustainable economy that benefits all Canadians over the long-term.,416
"We need to immediately build those sectors that benefit from the lower Canadian dollar manufacturing, tourism, value-added forest products and cultural industries.",408
We need to resurrect federal engagement in tourism promotion and support.,408
We need to embrace the 21st century economic revolution of clean technology.,501
These steps will assist in confronting the biggest threat to our economic future the decline in the Harper years of Canadian productivity.,408
"For the first time since records have been kept, Canada is falling far behind the U.S. in productivity.",408
More R & D and innovation will come from manufacturing and clean technology.,416
We are a nation of innovators.,416
"While Harper's policies reversed our economic progress, hitching us to our 19th century role as hewers of wood and drawers of water, Canadians are ready for a sustainable, clean 21st century economy.",416
"BECAUSE TOMORROW IS SERIOUS BUSINESS, OUR TOP ECONOMIC PRIORITIES ARE TO:",NA
1- ESTABLISH A CANADIAN SUSTAINABLE GENERATIONS FUND,NA
"Secure Canada's economic leadership over the coming decade by creating a fund to invest in skills-training,",411
"education,",506
"energy efficiency,",501
"renewables,",501
and emerging technologies.,411
"We will capitalize this fund by expanding revenue through returning corporate tax rates on large corporations to the 2009 level (19 percent),",403
"eliminating tax havens and tax credits used by the extremely wealthy,",403
"taxing pollution and waste,",501
"increasing the efficiency of our tax system,",503
and working with provinces to increase resource extraction royalties.,403
The time has come to redesign our tax system for the 21st century economy.,403
"As a starting point, in line with fundamental principles of fairness, efficiency and equity, we will eliminate the exemptions, special cases and tax breaks for favoured interests",403
"These boutique tax cuts have complicated our tax code, needlessly increasing complexity.",403
"We must ensure the tax system helps, not hinders, Canadians.",403
These changes will ensure that we capture and secure economic benefits for all Canadians.,410
Canada is one of the safest places in the world to invest.,410
"Rather than investing abroad, the majority of the Canadian Sustainable Generations Fund will be invested here in Canada",410
€“ in Canadian jobs,",410"""
"education,",506
"infrastructure,",411
"small-business,",402
and communities.,606
2- ROLL OUT A NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE JOBS PLAN,NA
"Put Canadians to work by investing in well-paying, local, and sustainable jobs in our communities.",416
Building a sustainable economy is serious business.,416
"Boom and bust cycles in the extractive industries have taken a heavy toll on Canadian families and communities, and it's long past time for us to invest in reliable, long-term, local jobs.",416
"The Canadian Sustainable Generations Fund will make critical investments in trades, apprenticeships, and education, and will ensure that all Canadians have the skills and training to prosper today and contribute to building the Canada of tomorrow.",411
"These investments in skills training will complement targeted national infrastructure investments in energy efficiency, renewable energy production, digital upgrades, clean-tech manufacturing, tourism, the creative economy, and emerging technologies.",501
"The gap between the infrastructure funding our cities and towns need, and the funding they receive, is reaching crisis levels Canada's infrastructure deficit is estimated to be upwards of $350-billion.",411
"We will work to close this gap by committing $6.4 billion per year, one point of the GST, to municipal infrastructure providing stable, long-term funding to Canadian municipalities, creating good local jobs, and building vibrant, safe, and livable Canadian towns and cities.",411
"We will create a Canadian Infrastructure Bank to provide more robust and innovative financing and investment partnerships, in order to build safer bridges, better roads, world-class water treatment facilities, affordable housing, efficient public transportation, and expanded broadband access putting thousands of Canadians to work in the process.",411
"We will create additional sustainable jobs by reintroducing and expanding the home renovation tax credit, to create incentives for individuals and companies to make their homes and businesses more efficient and accessible by installing high-efficiency insulation, solar heating and electricity, energyefficient appliances, and accessibility upgrades.",501
"And we will unleash an army of carpenters, electricians and contractors to take outdated and leaky public buildings schools, universities and hospitals and plug the leaks that increase greenhouse gases and costs.",501
These changes alone will reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent nationwide.,501
"3- SLASH CANADA'S STUDENT DEBT TODAY, AND ABOLISH TUITION FEES FOR COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES",NA
"It's time to break the status quo on education in Canada and abolish tuition fees for college, university and skills training programs.",506
"Whether Germany, Austria, Norway, Sweden, or Finland, many of the world's most successful economies have proven that expanding the public education system to include post-secondary increases prosperity, equality, productivity, and economic competitiveness.",506
"We will start investing in Canada's future by abolishing tuition fees for students without adequate financial means,",506
including removing the inadequate 2% annual cap on increased funding for post secondary education for all First Nations and Inuit students.,506
"Through consultation and collaboration with provincial governments and universities and colleges,",301
"by 2020 we will abolish tuition fees for post-secondary education and skills training for Canadians, guaranteeing that income is never a barrier for qualified students.",506
"It is widely recognized that Canada's success depends on an educated population, yet we burden youth with tens of thousands of dollars in student debt.",506
"As our plan to abolish tuition fees is being phased in, we will invest in the success of current students, jumpstart the Canadian economy,",506
and give our graduates a hand-up by implementing a debt-forgiveness program.,506
"Our plan will eliminate any existing or future student federal debt above $10,000.",506
We will abolish charging interest on new student loans,506
and will increase available funding for bursaries.,506
"It is unacceptable to the Green Party, and should be unacceptable to every Canadian, that the unemployment rate among Canadian youth is twice the national average.",503
The actual youth unemployment rate is likely much higher as many young people have given up on finding that first job and are no longer counted.,503
"Investment in Canadian skills, training, and education is a proven means to create real jobs, and is the backbone of Canada's future as a sustainability superpower.",506
"But for many young people just getting out of school, they face a Catch-22.",503
They cannot get hired in new jobs because they lack experience,503
"But unless they get that first job, they'll never have experience.",503
"Greens will create a national Community and Environment Service Corps, which will provide $1 billion/year to municipalities to hire Canadian youth to do work that needs to be done.",504
4- PARTNERING WITH FIRST NATIONS FOR TRULY RESPONSIBLE RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT IN THE LONG-TERM PUBLIC INTEREST,NA
Building a new era of nation-to-nation respect and partnership starts with recognizing First Nations' inherent rights and title.,301
"We will work together to negotiate comprehensive Indigenous self-governance arrangements, and bury the Indian Act.",301
"Our Council of Canadian Governments will, for the first time, engage First Nations, Metis and Inuit leadership as full partners in inter-governmental decision-making for the good of us all and not solely on indigenous issues.",301
We recognize that First Nations communities have been at the forefront of stalling irresponsible resource development projects like the Enbridge pipeline.,202
"We will work with First Nations and with the provinces to ensure that the responsible development of Canada's natural-resource wealth benefits all Canadians, beginning with the consent of the peoples on whose traditional territories they exist.",202
"Truly responsible resource development means securing Canada's endowment of living systems and natural wealth, by setting strict rules on industrial development to eliminate waste and environmental pollution,",501
"limiting foreign control over Canadian resources,",403
and putting an end to high-risk plans for new raw bitumen export pipelines and tankers.,501
"By investing heavily in advanced skills training,",411
"expanding support for trades and apprentice programs,",411
"and capturing additional value by processing resources here in Canada,",410
we will create good jobs in the resource sector and in local communities.,410
All while ensuring Canadians who call this place home have a say in developing our resources.,202
5- PUTTING CANADIAN SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS FIRST,NA
Ensure Canadian small business owners and entrepreneurs have access to the funds they need to create local jobs and revitalize local economies.,402
Small businesses and the Canadians who own them are the central driver of our economy.,410
They create more jobs than any other part of our economy.,410
"And those incomes and profits remain in the community, providing stable employment.",410
"As an added bonus, their flexible nature allows them to respond to environmental and market demands well before large corporations take action.",410
Putting Canadian small businesses first means reducing red tape for small business owners,303
"and enacting Think Small First€ legislation to ensure that new federal laws and regulations enhance, rather than hinder, an economic environment where local businesses and entrepreneurs can thrive.",303
We will create federally-funded $1 billion per year Green Technology Commercialization Grants to accelerate emerging technologies and give Canadian entrepreneurs a head start.,402
"By facilitating increased access to early-stage financing, the Green Technology Commercialization Grant will help our entrepreneurs compete internationally.",402
"It will help good ideas and emerging technology get to market, growing our sustainable economy and creating good local jobs and opportunities in our communities",402
6- SUPPORTING LOCAL FOOD AND SMALL-SCALE PRODUCERS,NA
"In a time of dominance by global industrial food systems, we want to rebalance the equation by creating resilient local economies fueled by local growers, farmers, and producers.",703
"Markets for local and organic food are growing rapidly, and a new generation of young Canadians want to try their hand at farming, yet starting out remains a daunting prospect, requiring financial risk that many young would-be farmers are unwilling to take.",703
We believe that Canadians who want to enter into agriculture should be supported to do so.,703
"We will fund community supported agriculture, farmers' markets, small-scale farms and producers, and the wineries and microbreweries that Canadians love.",703
"Finally, we will shift government-supported research away from biotechnology and energy-intensive farming and towards organic and sustainable food production.",501
We have the successful twenty-plus year legacy of Environmental Farm Plan assessments to build upon in which tens of thousands of family farms voluntarily adopted more efficient farming practices.,501
STRONG COMMUNITIES - BECAUSE CANADA DEPENDS ON IT.,NA
"At its heart, Canada is a community of communities, working together with a shared sense of purpose.",606
"Our nation needs a government that will invest in the fundamental building blocks on which our neighbourhoods rely from healthcare to transit, child care to public parks, bridges to local agriculture.",504
All with the aim of increasing the affordability and livability of the towns and cities we call home.,504
The current situation is not working for many Canadians.,503
The dream of homeownership and affordable rental housing is slipping away.,503
"Canadians are being asked to pay out-of-pocket for everything from prescription medicine to dental care, while child care is becoming increasingly unaffordable.",503
"Today, even two-income households are having trouble making ends meet month in, month out.",503
"To add insult to injury, consecutive federal governments have allowed critical infrastructure to go without needed maintenance.",411
Lack of investment in the infrastructure that makes our cities productive and our towns livable is risky behaviour.,411
"Crumbling bridges, aging and insufficient transit, nonexistent rail infrastructure these problems are no longer rarities, they have become the norm.",411
We want to invest in our communities just as previous generations invested in the systems we have allowed to fall into disrepair.,411
A modern 21st century economy is undermined by deteriorating infrastructure.,411
"BECAUSE CANADA DEPENDS ON IT, OUR TOP PRIORITIES FOR BUILDING STRONG CANADIAN COMMUNITIES ARE TO:   1- DEFEND CANADA'S PUBLIC HEALTH CARE",NA
Defend single-payer universal health care.,504
Bring all parties back to the table for a renewal of the Health Accord.,301
"Innovate in health care through electronic health records,",504
"patient-centred team medicine built around the family physician working with nurse-practitioners, pharmacists, midwives, naturopaths and others.",504
"Expand health care to cover prescription medication for all Canadians and public dental coverage for low-income youth (under 18 years of age),",504
and increase the emphasis on preventative health care.,504
"Every developed country in the world with a universal health care system provides prescription drug coverage, except Canada.",504
"Truly universal health care means guaranteeing that all Canadians have access to the medication they need, and the Green Party will fight to expand public health care to cover prescription medication.",504
"We will implement a National Pharmacare Plan that, through the advantage of bulk buying, will actually save Canadians $11 billion each year.",504
"It will especially benefit senior citizens, who spend the most on prescription medication, and it will allow physicians and doctors to better track if patients are at risk of dangerous over-medication.",504
We will be far more rigorous in assessing new drug applications.,504
We will apply the gold standard for pharmaceutical review to ensure we reject drugs shown to hurt more people than they heal.,504
"At the same time, our Pharmacare Plan will provide much needed coverage to the millions of Canadians who are forced to pay out-of-pocket for prescription medication every year.",504
"It is appalling that in a country as wealthy as Canada, our children do not have guaranteed no-cost access to high quality dental care.",504
"In order to address the crisis among the most marginal in our society, we will expand our public health care coverage to include dental coverage for low-income Canadians under the age of eighteen.",504
Canadians know that the best way we can reduce the burden on our health care system is to work to ensure we don't get sick in the first place.,504
"Despite this, our medical system focuses disproportionately on cure and not enough on prevention.",504
"We will work with the provinces to develop preventative health care guidelines that incentivize active lifestyles and healthy diets, saving our system millions by keeping Canadians healthy from childhood onwards.",504
"As a first order of business after the election, we will ensure the National Conference on Lyme Disease, required by law in the Green Party's first bill, will develop a national strategy to confront this growing threat.",504
It is scheduled for November to be chaired by the federal Minister of Health.,504
"As part of the big picture project of creating healthy communities, we will adopt stricter regulations to prohibit cancer-causing chemicals in our food and consumer products.",403
The Green Party supports expansion of CPP as the most reliable and predictable pension plan.,504
2. IMPLEMENT A NATIONAL SENIORS STRATEGY,NA
"The Conservative approach to public policy is a series of unrelated, gimmicky, vote-buying schemes.",305
Canada's seniors deserve better.,706
"We will work through the Council of Canadian Governments to develop a National Seniors Strategy with the following elements:  A Housing plan,",504
"with affordable, predictable home care support;",504
A Guaranteed Livable Income to ensure no Canadian lives in poverty;,504
Pharmacare strongly benefits seniors;,504
"A National Dementia Strategy,",504
including more long-term care beds in neighbourhood facilities;,504
An approach that supports aging in place€;,504
"Pension protection,",504
expansion of CPP;,504
Promotion of intergenerational programs that allow our kids from toddlers to high school students to visit seniors and develop relationships that have proven benefits to both generations;,606
Convenient and safe public transport to support independent living;,411
Access to the equity in homes to support day-to-day living expenses;,504
Addressing the Supreme Court of Canada decision to allow physician-assisted death.,604
"The most extreme challenges of aging are experienced by seniors living in poverty, a disproportionate proportion of whom are women.",503
"While the percentage of seniors living in poverty dropped dramatically from a high of approximately 30 percent in 1976, to a low of 4.7 percent in 2007, the poverty rates for seniors have begun to move up once again 5.8 percent in 2008.",503
We cannot be complacent about the economic struggles of seniors.,503
The Green Party supports expansion of CPP as the most reliable and predictable pension plan.,504
3. ELIMINATE POVERTY AND CHALLENGE INEQUALITY,NA
"Implementing a Guaranteed Livable Income,",504
"ensuring equal pay for equal work,",503
"and ensuring high quality child care for every Canadian family who wants it,",504
while providing a school nutrition program providing healthy food to kids in school to help them learn better.,504
"Despite the growing number of two-income households, Canadian families are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet.",503
"Green Party programs and policies will reduce income inequality, and ensure all Canadians have the opportunity to prosper.",503
"We will phase-in a national Guaranteed Livable Income, to ensure that no person's income falls below what is necessary for health, life and dignity.",504
Through the Council of Canadian Governments we will work with the other levels of government,301
"whose inadequate poverty band-aid solutions (such as welfare, disability programs) can be rolled up in order to fund Guaranteed Livable Income.",504
"Providing our most at-risk citizens with the resources they need to make ends meet greatly reduces the burden on our emergency and social services, our health care and criminal justice systems saving Canadian society money and empowering all citizens to overcome periods of hardship.",504
"As an immediate first step, the Green Party would implement a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour.",412
"By providing a cheque to every Canadian over 18, the carbon fee and dividend system will also assist in providing help to those who need it most.",504
We will implement a National Housing Strategy based on Housing First principles.,504
"Housing First is a proven, recovery-oriented approach that centres on quickly moving people experiencing homelessness into independent, permanent housing,",504
and then providing additional supports and services as needed.,504
"This strategy will guarantee dignity and support for Canadians at the margins of our society, and will help address homelessness while at the same time reducing the burden on our emergency and health services.",504
"Our Housing Strategy will address the continuum of needs from social housing for those in poverty or dealing with mental health and addiction problems, to First Nations, Metis, and Inuit housing crises, to the market failures depriving those with even a decent income of access to the affordable housing they need.",504
"We can ensure that all housing needs are met whether seniors, youth, or the stressed middle class.",504
"It is a black mark against Canada that, in 2015, Canadian women earn, on average, $8,000 less per year than their male counterparts for doing the same jobs.",503
"We will fight to end gender-based discrimination in the workplace and in Canadian society at large,",503
and ensure that Canada eliminates the gender wage gap once and for all.,503
"Although we must continue to work to address deeply-rooted gender bias in Canadian society, it will take time.",503
One important step is ensuring high-quality affordable child care.,504
"We will work with the provinces, territories and Indigenous communities",301
"to establish accessible, convenient, enriched and affordable child care spaces for any Canadian family that seeks it.",504
We will support women to re-enter the workforce whenever they choose after having children.,504
"The Green Party believes that workplace childcare has many advantages enhanced parenting time and access to children through the work day, extension of breast-feeding opportunities, improved employee productivity, and improving the convenience of public transport when parents and kids share their morning destination.",504
Tax breaks to employers for the creation of child care spaces is one tool among many we will use to ensure that families have the spaces they need.,504
4. BUILD STRONG FIRST NATIONS AND INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES,NA
We need to move to implement the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.,705
"The path to justice, healing and reconciliation begins with accepting a painful truth: the horrors of the residential school system constituted a policy of cultural genocide.",705
There is no way to undo the damage nor to compensate for the grief and loss of many generations of children and families.,705
"The truth is hard to absorb, but absorb it we must.",705
"True reconciliation will take time, and while we work to build a new, nation-to-nation partnership based on mutual respect and understanding, there are urgent and important steps that must be taken by the federal government to put the relationship on firmer footing.",705
"We begin by recognizing indigenous rights and title,",301
"and will negotiate in good faith to settle land claims, establish treaties and self-government arrangements, and move to repeal the Indian Act should that be the consensus of First Nations.",301
We will respect the rights of First Nations to take leadership of development projects on their traditional territories.,301
"Creating opportunity for indigenous communities and their people means ensuring access to quality public services for all First Nations, Metis and Inuit.",504
"It requires adequate funding for housing,",504
"education,",506
"and health care, both on and off reserves.",504
"We will work to expand rural health care infrastructure by investing in telehealth and mobile medical units, to ensure indigenous communities have access to critical care.",504
The ongoing crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women must be urgently addressed.,503
We will launch a national inquiry,503
and fight to ensure that structural violence against indigenous communities is addressed.,503
"We also recognize the critical importance of defending languages and cultures,",607
and will provide new federal funding for culturally appropriate education in traditional languages.,607
5. REVERSE CBC-RADIO CANADA FUNDING CUTS,NA
Investing an additional $285-million in the first year of our new Green Parliament,502
and $315 million in every subsequent year to protect our national broadcaster.,502
"We will ensure Radio Canada and CBC have adequate and stable funding,",502
"reversing the Harper Conservatives' $117-million cut,",502
and investing an additional $168-million and $315 million every year thereafter to rebuild the CBC and Radio-Canada's local coverage and capacity.,502
We will also restructure the governance structure of the public broadcaster to end the political influence of partisan cronies being appointed to the board.,304
"We need to re-invest in a CBC/Radio-Canada that is distinctly public and distinctly Canadian, ensuring our public broadcaster has the resources and expertise to provide quality local news coverage from our biggest communities to our smallest.",502
"The CBC and Radio Canada define what it means to be Canadian by covering the unique, the unconventional, and the truly Canadian.",601
We'll make sure it has adequate and sustainable funding so it can continue to enrich our lives for years to come.,502
"In addition, we will increase funding to all of Canada's arts and culture organizations including the Canada Council for the Arts and Telefilm Canada.",502
"In addition to restoring funding to CBC and Radio-Canada,",502
"we will work to rebuild the arm's length governance of our arts and cultural institutions to prevent political interference,",304
"prevent further monopolization of Canadian media,",403
and defend the freedom and integrity of the internet by enshrining the principle of net-neutrality€ in Canadian legislation.,201
We must be very concerned about the threat of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and its Crown Corporation provisions.,406
"If adopted, it could undermine our ability to maintain many public services provided through Crown corporations, including to our cultural industries.",406
6. PROTECTING CANADA POST,NA
Daily mail service to everyone's front door.,413
Canadians in the 21st century deserve postal service to their doors.,413
"Canada Post is experiencing a decline in letter service, but an increase in parcel delivery.",413
The impact of the internet cuts both ways: more emails reduce letters by post; on-line shopping has increased parcels.,413
Small business is very dependent on postal service.,413
We cannot afford to lose a strong Canada Post.,413
"Fortunately, Canada Post is still profitable.",413
It can be sustainable and profitable into the future.,413
CUPW has long advocated a diversification of services.,413
This is particularly valuable as Canada Post is in every community big and small.,413
"As commercial banks have withdrawn their physical presence in many communities, Canada Post can offer much needed services.",413
"Other countries have allowed their postal services to sell insurance, provide banking services and other services to remote communities.",413
Perhaps the best model is Israel where postal service has been diversified with over 70 different products and services.,413
We will reverse recent decisions to reduce home delivery,413
and we will set Canada Post on a profitable course for its future.,413
7- KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES SAFE,NA
Creating peace of mind for Canadians by reversing funding cuts,605
"and re-investing in disaster preparedness,",605
"training,",104
and equipment for our forces on the frontlines of keeping our communities safe.,104
"We must make sure that the Canadians tasked with keeping us safe are fully-resourced, well-trained, and equipped to fulfill their mission from the Canadian Forces",104
"to civilian forces like the Coast Guard, Park Rangers, Fisheries Patrol, Canadian Space Agency, and Northern Rangers.",605
We will re-open the shuttered Coast Guard stations on our coastlines.,605
Keeping our communities safe means strengthening Canada's defence capacity by prioritizing roles and missions for our forces that focus on peacekeeping;,107
defensive missions with our allies;,104
"border, northern, and coast guard patrols;",605
search and rescue missions;,605
and patrolling our parks.,605
Recognizing the critical role that our forces play also means respecting and truly taking care of our veterans.,504
"Canadian veterans deserve our grateful and ongoing support, including secure and generous pensions.",504
Our veterans should never be forced to fight in the courts to secure their long-term benefits or to ensure that Veterans Affairs disability pension promises are honoured.,504
"We will re-open the Veterans Affairs offices across Canada, reversing the $200 million cut to Veterans Affairs.",504
"Our veterans deserve more than to be left on hold with a government 1-800 number that is never answered, instead of the help they need from a compassionate person who knows their situation.",504
We will ensure access to service dogs trained to assist veterans suffering from Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder.,504
"Perhaps most importantly, keeping our communities safe means building Canada's disaster preparedness capacity.",605
"We will invest in comprehensive earthquake, forest fire, flooding and tsunami response plans to bring Canadian disaster readiness up to world-class standards, so we can more ably respond to the extreme weather events that are becoming more common as the climate changes.",605
GOOD GOVERNMENT - BECAUSE IT'S TIME TO RESTORE DEMOCRACY.,NA
"Good government is founded on prudent planning and rational, evidence-based decision-making in the public interest.",202
"Good government provides long-term stability, security from threats both domestic and abroad, and a vision that stretches well beyond fouryear election cycles.",202
"To deliver on these basic principles, government needs to engage with, and be responsive to, the concerns of Canadian citizens.",202
"The critical first step in this process is to ensure we have a government that represents the will of the people that means an end to first-past-thepost voting, an end to false majorities, and the creation of a voting system that ensures all Canadians have a voice in our government.",202
The Green Party is the only party committed to ending whipped votes.,202
"MPs from the other parties in Parliament routinely face whipped votes they must vote the party line or face punishments, such as not being allowed to speak in the House or even being thrown out of the party.",202
No Green MP will ever face a whipped vote.,202
They will be free to put their conscience and their constituents first.,202
"That is the commitment Green candidates make, to be your voice in Ottawa, your local champions.",305
"BECAUSE IT'S TIME TO RESTORE DEMOCRACY, OUR TOP PRIORITIES ARE TO:   1- ELECT MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO ARE HONEST, ETHICAL, HARD-WORKING REPRESENTATIVES FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND CHAMPIONS FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES",NA
When you look at the Green candidates across Canada you will not find a single career politician.€,305
"You will find people with impressive resumes whether in science, law, academia, teaching, public policy, small business, the arts, journalism, First Nations leadership, municipal government, community organizing and volunteerism, and medicine.",305
The health of our democracy depends on electing Members of Parliament who are accountable to their constituents.,202
"Following Elizabeth May's example, Green Members of Parliament will work tirelessly on behalf of their communities",305
and never abuse the public trust placed in them.,304
"Green MPs will conduct themselves with integrity and civility,",305
"treat others with respect,",305
and never heckle in the House of Commons,202
Green MPs will always keep the interests of Canada paramount,202
and never be told to vote against the interests and well-being of their constituents.,202
"Green MPs will seek constructive solutions to issues in their local communities, striving to create dialogue and solve problems when they arise.",202
"Green MPs will publish their expenses online, to ensure maximum transparency and accountability,",304
and never use Parliamentary resources for party or personal benefit.,304
2- RESTORE CANADIAN PUBLIC SCIENCE AND THE ROLE OF EVIDENCE IN OUR DECISION MAKING,NA
Good policy and keeping government accountable depends on good information.,303
"Under Stephen Harper, Canada moved from evidence-based policy making to policy-based evidence-making.",305
Funding for basic research and scientists in Canada is at an all-time low; research at small universities is disappearing and we are rapidly losing our capacity for long-term innovation.,305
"As a result of the Harper Conservatives' decision to eliminate the long-form census, Canadian researchers, tracking everything from poverty to public health, know less and less about our country as time progresses.",305
"Science, evidence, and transparency together form the backbone of informed decision-making.",303
We will immediately restore the long-form census to ensure that Canadian researchers and policy-makers have access to the latest data.,303
"Canadian scientists, both inside and outside of government, must have the freedom to pursue important discoveries, without looking over their shoulders and worrying about whether their work is industry relevant€ or subject to political interference in funding decisions.",303
We will fight to ensure Canada remains a world leader in discovery science by enacting Public Access to Science legislation to ensure our scientists are unmuzzled and free to discuss their findings with the media and the Canadian public without censorship or political interference.,201
Our open science legislation would also ensure that all government-funded scientific research is publicly accessible by law.,201
"We will begin to rebuild the public scientific capacity lost during the past decade by providing $75-million annually to add critical science capacity to Environment Canada, Health Canada, Parks Canada, and Fisheries and Oceans.",411
"We will implement new legislation to ensure that any new laws or regulations are based on sound evidence that is transparent, rigorous, ethically produced, easy to access and understand, based on the best available information and free from political manipulation",303
Elizabeth May's bill (which died on the order paper due to the August 2 writ) will be re-entered to mandate that all publicly-funded science must be published.,303
"We are committed to restoring the role of Canadian science as part of our wider vision of bringing back evidence-based planning and decision-making around climate change, criminal justice, drug policy, harm reduction, homelessness, and more.",303
"3- CREATE A COUNCIL OF CANADIAN GOVERNMENTS TO FIND SOLUTIONS WITHIN CANADA, AND WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR ALLIES ABROAD",NA
Canada's success has always depended on people working together.,606
We are a country of vast geography and distinct regions.,606
Good and effective government in Canada depends on bringing people together with a shared sense of purpose.,606
"In an era of global insecurity, it is more important than ever that we work together here at home.",606
"In the 21st century, we need to reinvent the way we work as a federation.",301
We need to work together to develop national goals and national strategies.,301
"To this end, we will create a Council of Canadian Governments to address shared challenges and ensure more effective collaboration between the various levels of government in Canada federal, provincial/territorial, municipal/local, and First Nations, Metis and Inuit.",301
"Chaired by the federal government, the Council will regularly bring together the provinces and territories, municipal governments, and Indigenous leadership to ensure constructive collaboration to find real solutions for the problems that concern all Canadians from security to infrastructure to health care.",301
"In order to make progress on these critical issues, it is important that all levels of government are pulling in the same direction.",301
"With a transparent process, a published agenda and a clear path to set in place national strategies on energy, transportation, culture, health care, and climate.",301
It is simply absurd that Canada has more internal domestic barriers to trade and movement of workers than the European Union has among 28 separate and sovereign nation states.,401
"Canadian workers should be free to move anywhere in the country, without worrying about whether their certifications are recognized in one place or another.",401
The Council of Canadian Governments will be the catalyst for a new era of cooperation that establishes common standards to improve interprovincial labour mobility,401
and work towards recognition for international accreditations.,701
"The bottom line is this when our federal, provincial, municipal and First Nations governments work together, we can bring down barriers that restrict our employment opportunities and keep families apart.",301
"From climate change to terrorism, we will work together with our allies to counter threats and ensure a safer world.",107
"We will strengthen our international influence by investing in our diplomatic skills and talent,",107
"and shift our focus and funding away from NATO military contributions,",105
"towards United Nations peacekeeping, poverty alleviation and disaster relief efforts.",107
We will commit to ending poverty globally by contributing 0.7% of GDP to official development assistance.,107
We will not purchase the F-35 stealth fighter jets.,105
We will invest in new military equipment that fits Canada's defence requirements.,104
"We will purchase fixed-wing search and rescue planes, ice-breakers and replace dangerous old military hardware to ensure that threats to our military are not posed by the equipment we give them.",104
We will overhaul our immigration and refugee protection system to ensure that Canada is seen as a welcoming and compassionate home for people fleeing violence and persecution.,705
Our immigration system should welcome and integrate new Canadians over the long term.,705
"The short-term employment focus of the Temporary Foreign Workers Programs both exploits those workers, often denied a route to Canadian citizenship, while denying Canadians those job opportunities.",705
We will reverse numerous changes to our laws that have created two-tiers of Canadian citizenship with some deemed more Canadian than others.,705
The matter of citizenship should never be political.,705
It must be based on facts,705
You are born here or you are naturalized a Canadian citizen.,705
Canadian citizens who violate the law go to jail.,705
But to create the notion that citizenship can be revoked for anything other than fraud in obtaining that citizenship is to move into a shifting and uncertain understanding of what it is to be Canadian.,705
We will act to resolve the confusion created for the lost Canadians€ one million Canadians have effectively been denied recognition of their citizenship including thousands of our war dead.,705
We will repeal as unconstitutional the Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).,705
It essentially deprives any Canadian with US connections (even those short of dual citizenship) of full rights to privacy and treats them as a lesser Canadian.,705
We will also repeal Bill C-24 which allows the minister of citizenship to revoke citizenship.,705
Other threats to Canadians will be eliminated with the repeal of Bill C-51.,705
4. REPEAL BILL C-51 TO DEFEND CANADIANS' CHARTER RIGHTS AND PRIVACY,NA
"Presented as an anti-terror€ bill by the Harper Conservatives, Bill C-51 needlessly expands the powers of Canada's spy agencies, without creating the necessary oversight.",201
"At the same time, it actually undermines our policing efforts to abort terrorist plots.",201
It is a dangerous piece of legislation that does not make us safer.,201
"We were the first party to oppose Bill C-51 in the House of Commons,",201
and we will continue to fight to repeal this Bill,201
and defend Canadians' constitutionally guaranteed rights and freedoms.,201
"Among the thousands of ordinary Canadians of all political stripes who spoke out in opposition to Bill C-51, four former Prime Ministers, five former Justices of the Supreme Court, and over 100 independent legal scholars expressed profound concern with this ineffective, harmful, and overreaching new law.",201
Canada already has effective anti-terror laws that do not trample on our rights as egregiously as Bill C-51 does.,201
The RCMP has used these existing powers to keep Canadians safe; for this they deserve Canadians' gratitude.,201
"Bill C-51 allows widespread government surveillance and intrusions into Canadians' privacy, will not make Canadians safer, and, in fact, will make us less safe.",201
"Without any oversight or obligation to share information with RCMP, CSIS is allowed to secretly intervene in suspicious activity without coordinating with other security forces.",201
This is a recipe for disaster.,201
We now know that the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) already collects millions of Internet communications every day from average Canadians.,201
Canada Border Services also has no review or oversight mechanism.,202
"And none of these agencies, all tasked in one way of another with confronting terrorism, have any oversight individually and no requirement to share information with each other.",202
This is unacceptable.,202
"At a time when the United States is beginning to rebalance the relationship between government surveillance and the privacy of its citizens, the information sharing provisions in Bill C-51 will decisively tip the scales toward unchecked government intervention into our personal lives.",201
"Bill C-51 must be repealed, as it infringes on the political and civil rights granted to all of us under the Canadian Charter.",201
"For these reasons, Green MPs will make the repeal of Bill C-51 a top priority in Parliament.",201
5- REPLACE THE FIRST-PAST-THE-POST SYSTEM WITH PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION,NA
Our current voting system is outdated.,202
It is the only voting system that allows a minority of the votes to elect a majority government with 100 percent of the power.,202
It makes voters feel as if their vote just doesn't count.,202
It is time to replace it.,202
The first-past-the-post voting system has lost the confidence of Canadians.,202
Our promise is to replace the first-past-the-post system with a form of proportional representation within the first year of the next Parliament.,202
We will determine the form of proportional representation best suited to Canada through extensive public consultation by an all-party committee.,202
"We will overhaul the Fair€ Elections Act, establishing mechanisms that increase voter participation, and ensure greater fairness, transparency, and accountability in election financing.",202
"We will make the Commissioner of Canada Elections (CCE) responsible for investigations into campaign irregularities, reporting directly to Parliament,",202
and give him or her the power to fully investigate and hold to account anyone who breaks Canada's electoral laws.,202
The Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) should be clearly mandated to encourage voter turnout.,202
Both the CCE and CEO should be appointed by an impartial Public Appointments Commission.,202
"To strengthen local democracy and enhance the freedom of MPs to stand up for the interests of their constituents, we will amend the Elections Act to remove the requirement that party leaders need to sign the nomination papers of candidates, giving this power instead to the local organizations.",202
"In opening up the Elections Act, we will un-do damaging changes made in the Harper era that undermine Canadians' right and ability to vote, whether living within Canada (youth, First Nations, homeless and others) or living overseas.",202
6- DEFEND CANADA'S SOVEREIGNTY,NA
"Of all the damaging things done to Canada in the last nine years, ratifying the Canada-China Investment Treaty in secret, by Cabinet alone, without any parliamentary or public hearings poses the greatest long-term threat to our sovereignty.",406
"The treaty, known as a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement or FIPA, is lop-sided, benefiting the Peoples' Republic of China, while providing no advantage to Canada.",406
"In fact, it locks us in until the year 2045, giving State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) superior rights to those of Canadian companies.",406
Beijing's SOEs now have the right to bring arbitration claims against Canada in secret tribunals.,406
"These are not courts, but private arbitrations in which arbitrators gain personally and financially through a system that lacks the fairness and predictability of our national courts.",406
"Thanks to Stephen Harper, our sovereignty has been significantly eroded.",305
"In the next parliament, Green MPs will press for legislation to require that any and all complaints from Beijing under this treaty, even early diplomatic complaints, must be made public.",406
We must ensure that all the other party leaders understand that Canadians want to fight for our laws and push back against complaints from SOEs from the People's Republic of China.,406
"If Beijing complains about a municipal by-law or proposed legislative change, such as reversing the damage to the Fisheries Act, Environmental Assessment or Navigable Waters Protection Act, we will not cave.",406
We will not let FIPA-chill cause government to pull back from doing the right thing.,406
"We need a transparent commitment to aggressively defend Canada's policies and decisions, and, if we must, to write a cheque for damages under FIPA, rather than cancel planned laws or repeal existing ones.",406
We will vigorously oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),406
and the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA).,406
Greens will also work with Green MPs in governments around the world to open a full-scale global review of all investor-state agreements with the goal of revising and improving all of them to rebalance rights to democracies and reduce global corporate rule.,406
7- REVERSE HARPER'S LEGACY TO PUT OUR GOVERNMENT BACK ON TRACK,NA
Over the last decade there have been unprecedented changes to the way our government operates,305
"Our government now functions in the least transparent, least accountable, most partisan and divisive manner in Canadian history.",305
The Harper Conservatives' invented the use of omnibus budget bills bills that cover dozens of diverse and unrelated changes to law and policy.,305
"Such bills have been rammed through Parliament time and time again since 2011, without proper study.",305
"With the might makes right€ style of Stephen Harper, over 99 percent of opposition party amendments were routinely rejected.",305
Omnibus budget bills have severely damaged our democracy.,305
"The Harper administration has used omnibus bills to devastate centuries-old environmental legislation, curb free speech, and cut billions in funding from health care.",305
"A single omnibus bill in spring 2012 (C-38) changed 70 laws, which even former Conservative ministers said undermined our fisheries and environment.",305
The Green Party will work to end the illegitimate use of omnibus bills.,202
These sweeping bills have no place in our democracy.,202
"In addition to ending the use of omnibus bills, Green MPs will restore all the environmental protections that the Harper government has eliminated over the past ten years.",501
"Due to Stephen Harper's shocking use of prorogation to avoid political embarrassment and confidence votes he knew he would lose, Canada now needs to control access to prorogation by requiring a 2/3 vote in Parliament.",202
We need new rules to require the summoning of a new parliament (within 30 days of an election) and for the dissolution of Parliament.,202
"We will work to end the American-style€ attack politics that is slowly becoming the norm in Canada, slashing the budget of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) by 50 percent.",202
"The PMO is a taxpayer-funded office that has become a partisan central agency, controlling all government MPs, Cabinet ministers, all operations, and even attempting to force non-partisan civil servants into partisan schemes.",202
The PMO now constitutes a daily contempt of Parliament.,202
"It spews out negative, partisan, and divisive campaigns.",202
"The PMO has exerted control over parliamentary legislative committees, demanding Conservative MPs attack witnesses who disagree with Conservative policy and whipping votes in committee.",202
The PMO has (in violation of our Constitution) also dictated votes in the Senate and even attempted to interfere in an audit of Senate expenses.,202
We will slash the advertising budget of the federal government.,202
All contracts must be publicly tendered on a website with decisions being removed from political operatives.,304
We must empower parliamentary committees to fully discharge their oversight responsibilities: appoint committee members for a full session of Parliament;,202
select chairs through secret ballots,202
and ensure adequate budgets;,202
"strengthen the mandates and establish genuine independence for officers of parliament (Parliamentary Budget Officer, Privacy and Information Commissioners, Auditor General, Commissioner for the Environment and Sustainable Development, Science Advisor, National Security Advisor).",304
"We will overhaul Accountability,",303
"Conflict of Interest,",304
Privacy,201
and Access to Information legislation.,201
It is time to curtail patronage through use of an independent Public Appointments Commission.,304
We need to act to diversify and enliven the media in Canada.,403
A robust news media is essential for an informed citizenry and a healthy democracy.,403
Canada's media has become dangerously concentrated in a few hands.,403
Recommendations have been made in numerous reports and Royal Commissions.,403
"It is time to act on these recommendations and apply anti-trust legislation to corporate media,",403
while restoring our public broadcaster and its essential role.,502
We will enshrine in the Constitution the right to a healthy environment.,201
We will act to reform the Senate.,204
A comprehensive proposal for an elected Senate by proportional representation must be developed,204
and approved by Canadians in a national referendum.,202
It is time to grasp the nettle and amend the constitutional amending formula to approve changes through a referendum mechanism.,204
The PMO is not part of our system of government.,202
It is not even mentioned in the Constitution.,202
It was invented in 1970.,202
"While initially exerting a minor level of control it has become too powerful, too centralized, and too unaccountable",202
"€“ its budget needs to be cut""",202
and practices reformed.,202
We must protect the fundamental principle that the prime minister reports to parliament; not the other way around.,202
BOLD CLIMATE ACTION - BECAUSE WE LIVE HERE.,NA
Climate change is both the biggest challenge and the biggest opportunity that Canada has ever faced.,501
"While the consequences of failing to address climate change would be catastrophic, our transition to a green, sustainable economy will create good local jobs, shorter commutes, more livable cities, and cleaner air and water.",416
Our plan is to move to the virtual elimination of fossil fuel use in Canada by mid-century.,501
"Our short-term target is 40 percent below 2005 levels by 2025,",501
while we are calling for 80 percent reductions below 1990 levels by 2050.,501
"These are ambitious targets, yet the scale and urgency of this challenge demands nothing less.",501
"As Canadians, we will rise to this challenge and, in doing so, create a strong, stable, and prosperous economy today and for our children and grandchildren tomorrow.",416
"For Canadians to benefit from this transition, we need to elect Green Members of Parliament. Only Green MPs will stand up to defend our coastlines from increased tanker traffic,",501
"our rivers and parks from reckless pipeline projects,",501
and our economy from further pursuit of high-risk extractive schemes that threaten Canada's long-term prosperity.,416
Only Green MPs will position our economy to reap the full benefits of the inevitable global shift to a fossil-fuel free economy.,416
It is time for Canada to take bold climate action.,501
"BECAUSE WE LIVE HERE, OUR TOP ENVIRONMENTAL PRIORITIES ARE TO:   1- DEFEND OUR COASTAL WATERS FROM RISKY PIPELINES AND OIL TANKERS",NA
Only Green MPs will put our coastal communities first by standing against all new raw bitumen export schemes.,501
"Kinder Morgan proposes a seven-fold increase in oil sands tanker traffic through Vancouver and Burnaby, while Energy East proposes to increase tanker traffic through the Bay of Fundy.",501
"These tankers would carry bitumen from the oil sands, mixed with toxic diluents to make it flow, a mixture that is impossible to clean up if spilled.",501
A single tanker accident would ruin our coast and the lives and livelihoods that depend on its health.,501
"That is why we recognize that the economic, social and environmental consequences of approving these projects is simply too high.",501
We will take a stand and defend our coastline.,501
Poll after poll shows that the people of the West Coast will not allow this risky project.,501
"More than half of British Columbians say they oppose the Kinder Morgan expansion, including more than three-quarters of young British Columbians.",501
Even the Ontario Energy Board has ruled that Energy East poses more risks than benefits.,501
"While the old parties use complaints about process to avoid taking a stand, or even fast track and support these projects outright, the Green Party is the only party standing up for the people and communities threatened by these projects.",305
2- ARREST THE GROWTH IN OIL SANDS EXPANSION,NA
"Protecting existing jobs in the industry,",410
"creating new jobs by upgrading and refining existing production,",410
"and providing skills training for workers who have been laid off or who want to transition to more stable, long-term jobs.",411
This strategy (more Peter Lougheed and less Ralph Klein) would actually help Alberta's economy avoid the disruptive boom and bust cycle.,416
"Given climate realities and volatile international oil prices, expanding oil sands production is simply not on.",416
Most of the bitumen in the Alberta oil sands must remain in the ground.,416
"We will create new jobs in Canada's oil and gas sector by refining the product we already produce, rather than shipping it out raw for refining in other countries.",410
"In addition to increasing our refining capacity, Canada should be home to leading the global clean technology industry an industry that has boomed in other countries like Germany, where over 1.4 million clean-tech jobs generate over 11 percent of the country's GDP.",416
"We need to respect the oil sands workers whose livelihoods still depend on the industry,",701
and to support the tens of thousands of oil sands workers who have recently been laid off.,411
"Canada should provide these workers with retraining to ensure they find good, long-term reliable jobs close to home, not jobs that are vulnerable to cycles of boom and bust and often thousands of kilometres away from their families.",411
"We must also provide urgent support to First Nations living downstream from the oil sands, whose communities and traditional foods are being contaminated by oil sands pollution in the Athabasca water and air sheds, with devastating health consequences.",501
3- IMPLEMENT A ROBUST CANADIAN CLIMATE AND ENERGY STRATEGY,NA
"Partnering with the provinces to price carbon,",501
"implement a Canadian Fee and Dividend Plan,",501
rapidly phase out coal-fired electricity,501
"and transition to a prosperous, decarbonized economy.",416
Climate and energy are two sides of the same coin.,501
"We urgently need a comprehensive, science-based national climate strategy to address rising sea levels, drought, extreme weather events, changing rainfall patterns, increased forest fires, melting permafrost and crumbling Arctic infrastructure.",501
A robust Canadian Climate and Energy Strategy begins with eliminating all fossil fuel subsidies.,501
"Canada currently provides more than $1 billion dollars a year in subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, meaning, on a per capita basis, Canadian taxpayers provide more handouts to the fossil fuel industry than almost every other country in the G20.",501
"Next, we must work together to put a national price on carbon.",501
"In the complete absence of federal leadership, the provinces have taken up the challenge of climate change on their own.",501
"Although some progress has been made, notably in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, this patchwork of climate strategies is an inefficient way to tackle an issue that faces all Canadians.",501
"The Carbon Fee and Dividend Plan is the smartest, most efficient, and most effective way to shift away from burning fossil fuels.",501
"We will place a fee on carbon,",501
and pay the funds it generates directly to every Canadian over age 18 in the form of an annual carbon dividend.,504
"This plan will defend our climate, diversify our energy mix, grow our economy, and ensure energy security for Canadians.",501
Most economists and climate scientists agree that fee and dividend provides an efficient and comprehensive solution to a complicated problem.,501
"British Columbia has had a carbon pricing plan in place since 2008, during which time BC's fuel use has dropped 16 percent, while GDP has outperformed the rest of Canada.",501
"It incentivizes investment in sustainable jobs and green technology, discourages waste and pollution, and puts money directly back into the pockets of average Canadians.",501
"We need to invest in an infrastructure that promotes renewable energy,",501
"and a more robust east-west electricity grid to promote renewable energy transmission between provinces,",501
while reducing the enormous waste in our energy systems.,501
We still waste more than half the energy we use.,501
t's time to save money and reduce pollution by going after waste.,501
4- CREATE A NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION STRATEGY WITH STRICT NEW RULES ON RAIL SAFETY,NA
Strict new rail safety laws and new investment for Canada's rail system €“,411
Restore Canadian railways with new funding,411
and stronger rules to ensure efficient rail travel and safe movement of hazardous industrial goods including oil and gas.,403
Canada's national rail systems are in decline.,411
"In much of Canada, rail routes that once moved thousands of people are abandoned.",411
"Edmonton to Calgary, Saskatoon to Regina, Halifax to Sydney have all been axed, despite their profitability.",411
"Green MPs will re-invest in our national rail systems,",411
"building more train cars in Canada,",411
"increasing train speeds,",411
"phasing in high-speed rail where feasible,",411
and creating green transportation and energy infrastructure corridors in key regions.,501
"An improved rail system will make Canada more economically competitive, create thousands of new jobs, reduce traffic congestion, and provide a fast, inexpensive and safe mode of transport in key commuter corridors.",411
We will develop a national transportation strategy,411
€“ investing in local public transit and expanding VIA Rail to provide more modern, efficient
"We will invest $600 million in 2016-2017,",411
building to $764 million by 2020 in VIA Rail.,411
Rebalancing the relationship between passenger trains and freight cargo will begin with a comprehensive plan to limit the burden on our rail system that has been created by exporting unprocessed oil by rail.,411
"Further, in order to reduce the risk to our communities and ensure that a tragedy like Lac Mgantic can never again occur, we will strengthen Canada's rail safety rules",403
"and give regulators the tools they need to protect our neighbourhoods from train derailments, especially those involving hazardous materials.",403
We will fund the re-routing of tracks for freight and rail yards away from populated areas.,411
5- END THERMAL COAL EXPORTS,NA
Work with provinces to ensure the rapid phase-out of coal fired generation plants within Canada.,501
"Like the now-shuttered asbestos industry, it is wrong for Canada to profit from the export of coal destined to be burned in foreign power plants to create pollution and dirty energy abroad, while at the same time we work to eliminate its use within Canada.",501
"Although solar energy is now cost competitive with the construction of new coal-fired power plants, existing coal-fired infrastructure at home and abroad is keeping the world on an unsustainable path.",501
