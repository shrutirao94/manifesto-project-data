The NDP recognizes that access to affordable housing and the ability to afford to heat and maintain your home is essential for all Canadians.,504
"Our plan will invest in green and affordable housing by:   Introducing a green home energy program to help retrofit at least 50,000 homes and apartment buildings.",501
"Through an initial investment of $200 million over four years, this initiative will help make homes and apartment buildings more efficient,",501

and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.,501

The government has many roles to play in ensuring workers are treated fairly and are working safely.,701
"For example, as a significant employer across Canada, the government has a duty to ensure that civil servants and federal contractors are paid the wages they have earned in a timely manner.",701
The NDP will stand up for workers in federal jurisdiction by:   Reinstating the federal minimum wage,412

"Abolished by the Conservatives, this law ensured that tradespeople working on federal contracts received fair compensation.",701

The nature of work has changed and it's harder for young Canadians to find a solid footing in the job market.,706
"Instead of raiding the Employment Insurance (EI) fund like the Liberals who raided $54 billion and the Conservatives,",305
the NDP will help young people get a strong start by making EI eligibility fairer,504
and by investing in training that will help workers improve their skills and get better jobs.,411
An NDP government will hold EI premiums steady for four years,402
"and invest in expanded training and benefits for young Canadians, precarious workers, workers in seasonal industries and new parents.",411

"He has slashed EI benefits,",305
continued the Liberal raid on the EI fund,305
and made it much harder for Canadians to access the fund,305
"Today, fewer Canadians than ever qualify for benefits,",305
and cuts to Service Canada mean that people who have followed all the rules are forced to wait weeks before receiving benefits for which they have paid.,305
Paul Martin launched the Liberals' cuts to Employment Insurance benefits in the 1990s,305
and raided more than $54 billion from the EI Fund.,305
Justin Trudeau says that was the right decision.€,305

Our government has to do more.,503
Much more.,503
PROTECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE,NA

DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS LIVING WITH DISABILITIES,NA
Stephen Harper's own report on how Canada is living up to the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) confirms that the government has done little to improve quality of life for persons living with disabilities.,305
Persons living with disabilities are twice as likely to be living in poverty compared to other Canadians.,503
"The situation is worse for persons with disabilities living in Indigenous communities,",503

The cuts to home delivery impact seniors and persons living with disabilities the most.,503

ENSURING LOW-INCOME YOUTH CAN PARTICIPATE IN SPORTS,NA
There is strong evidence that lower household incomes have a significant negative impact on children's enrolment in sports.,502
"Team sports are a great way for children to be active, but also to develop team and leadership skills that will serve them well later in life.",502
It's important that all children have the opportunity to participate in team sports.,502

We thought maybe change was coming at last.,705
"But as the years passed, there was no change.",705

SAFE AND SECURE CANADA,NA
"To build the country of our dreams, we must be secure in our freedoms and resolute in our openness to build a more inclusive society.",606
"Stephen Harper's narrow approach has left middle-class families less safe, both at home and abroad.",305
"He talks about being tough on crime, but we have fewer police on our streets to enforce the law.",305
"He claimed Bill C-51 would combat terror threats, but anti-terrorism experts say the bill not only threatens Canadians' rights and freedoms, it puts families at greater risk of terrorist attack.",305
"He promised smart foreign relations that would ensure Canada was respected on the world stage, but instead we were denied a seat on the UN Security Council and veterans who fought for our country have been left scrambling for basic dignity.",305
Reckless cuts and empty promises won't make Canadian families safer.,305
We need a plan that will ensure that the police who protect us at home,605
and our soldiers all over the world have the tools they need to do their jobs.,104
"More importantly, by building a more inclusive country, we will create more connected communities, increase our economic resilience and build the strong, safe communities that will make us the envy of the world.",606
MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER,NA
The NDP's plan for safer communities starts with an investment in more front-line police officers.,605
"It is boots on the ground that help to fight crime, not empty Conservative promises",305
"Stephen Harper's plan is failing and despite years of his 'tough on crime' rhetoric, the number of police officers per capita in Canada has been on the decline.",305
"For example, this past spring Stephen Harper promised the people of Surrey, BC, additional RCMP support to help address the city's increasing concerns over guns and gang violence, but he has failed to deliver.",305
"To help police protect our communities, the NDP will:   Work with provinces, territories, municipalities and Indigenous communities",301

"Giving police the tools they need to do their job by tackling the backlog in the Canadian Police Information Centre database, known as CPIC, a national tool for police and prosecutors to check the criminal history of suspects and those charged with or convicted of new offences.",605
New Democrats will free up front-line resources to ensure that police have the tools they need to keep our communities safe.,605
We will also make smart investments to ensure that police can focus on public safety.,605
"For example, front-line police have been calling for better strategies on mental health, like the ones outlined in our health care commitments.",605
We need a shift from dealing with the crisis to preventing the crisis from occurring in the first place.€ €“Jim Chu, former Chief of Vancouver Police Department

and taking action where necessary to lower speeds and re-route dangerous goods.,403
Few other regulatory roles of government are more important or more wide-ranging than ensuring the safety of our food supply.,403
Canadians have seen first-hand how the outbreak of a food-borne illness can have devastating and far-reaching consequences.,403
"In order to better protect Canadians and their food supply, the NDP will:   Undo the Conservatives' damaging cuts to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.",403
hese cuts have put the health and safety of Canadians at risk.,403

FIGHTING TERRORISM WHILE PROTECTING PERSONAL LIBERTIES,NA
Stephen Harper's Conservatives passed their dangerous and ineffective Bill C-51 with the support of the Liberals.,305
They teamed up to weaken the fundamental freedoms of every single Canadian.,305
That's wrong.,305
"The Liberals have tried to have their cake and eat it too when it comes to Bill C-51: after saying they opposed it, they voted with Stephen Harper to pass the bill.",305
Justin Trudeau referred to Bill C-51 as a great example of what Canadians expect their government to be able to do.,305
Then he said he thought it was probably unconstitutional.,305
Even Liberal candidates don't buy Justin Trudeau's failure of leadership on C-51.,305
Tom Mulcair's NDP voted against C-51 €“,305
and an NDP government is committed to fighting terrorism,605
while protecting our personal liberties.,201

CANADIAN FORCES IN THE 21ST CENTURY,NA

"A new vision is necessary to ensure that our military can defend Canada, protect Canadians, and contribute to international peace and security with an agile, well-equipped, world-class force.",104
"As a result of Conservative cuts, already long overdue new equipment purchases are being delayed for years.",305
The attempt to sole-source the F-35 fighter jet while hiding the full costs was just one of several major procurement failures on the Conservatives' watch.,305
But the most shameful failure of the Conservatives during their time in office is the treatment of members of the Canadian Armed Forces and veterans.,305
CAF members who have to sell their homes at a loss when they are transferred have been unfairly compensated.,305
The grievance process simply isn't working to resolve CAF members' issues.,305
"The Universality of Service policy has led to the unnecessary discharge of men and women, many of whom have been coping with mental or physical injury that could have been accommodated.",305
"Moreover, many have been released without adequate support to transition to a new life outside of the military.",305
"Additionally, the failure to acknowledge and address the problem of sexual harassment and assault in the military has been well-documented.",305
"Given these challenges, it's clear that Canada's defence policy requires review.",107

"To add insult to injury, Stephen Harper then spent nearly a million dollars of their own tax dollars fighting them in court.",305
"The Conservatives closed nine Veterans Affairs offices, which made it harder for veterans to get the services they need.",305
Tom Mulcair's plan will reverse the Conservatives' disrespect of these nation-builders with investments to improve medical care for Canada's veterans and their families.,504

"We will recognize the contributions of police, firefighters and other public safety officers by:   Establishing a Hero's Benefit to recognize the contributions of firefighters, police officers and other public safety officers who die or are permanently disabled in the line of duty.",504
RESTORING CANADA'S PLACE IN THE WORLD,NA
"The country that the Conservatives are projecting onto the world stage is no longer recognizable to many of the countries we have worked with closely over the decades, and it's no longer recognizable to us as Canadians.",305
Canada's role in the world in the past 10 years has become one where we lecture foreign governments at the United Nations and stymie progress to tackle climate change.,305
