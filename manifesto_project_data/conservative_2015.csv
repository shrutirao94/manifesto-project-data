PLATEFORME ELECTORALE PCC 2015  OUR CONSERVATIVE PLAN TO PROTECT THE ECONOMY  FOREWORD BY PRIME MINISTER STEPHEN HARPER,NA
"In this election, Canadians have a clear choice: a choice that carries the greatest of consequences for our economy, for our jobs, and for our families.  Amid a global economy that is once again weak and in turmoil, Canada's economy remains stronger than most but it's fragile, and needs protection from instability elsewhere in the world.  On October 19, Canadians will choose which party has the best plan, in these troubled times, to protect our economy and protect your job.  Because our economic vision for Canada is so different from that of our opponents, your choice will make a huge difference. Wrong government decisions on taxes, spending, and deficits will expose our economy to harm, and ultimately put the jobs of hard-working Canadians at risk.  For Conservatives, protecting Canada's economy is our number one priority.   That's why we have a positive plan to protect the economy and create jobs over the next four years, and beyond.  We'll:  Keep the federal budget balanced.  Lower taxes on small businesses and workers.  Aim to create another 1.3 million new, well-paying jobs by 2020.  Open new markets for Canadian businesses and products through the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Aim to add more than 700,000 new homeowners by 2020.  Provide new tax relief and benefits to families and seniors.   Our plan will keep Canada's economy moving forward.   It's the right plan for our economy.  It's the right plan for Canadians.   Of course, we'll also continue to protect Canadians in a dangerous and uncertain world, keeping our streets and communities safe.   But ultimately, all of these things depend on a strong and growing economy.  So the choice in this election is this: Which government do you trust to manage and protect the fragile Canadian economy, and your job, in the face of global economic turmoil?  Our Conservative Party is the only party with a proven economic record and a low-tax, balanced budget plan for the future.   Permanent deficits, higher taxes, and more debt, as proposed by the Liberals and the NDP, will wreck our economy, cost you money, and possibly your job.   This platform sets out a different, better plan for the next four years. It's our plan to make this country the greatest country in the world even stronger and more prosperous for hard-working Canadian families, now and for generations to come.   It's our Economic Action Plan. It's working. Let's continue on with what we know works.",NA
PROTECTING OUR ECONOMY: OUR CONSERVATIVE PLAN,NA
"We have a positive plan for the next four years to protect Canada's economy,",403
"create new, well-paying jobs,",410
and help families and seniors.,504
BALANCED BUDGET,NA
We balanced the budget last year one year ahead of schedule and already have a significant surplus for this year.,414
A balanced budget is the anchor of our low-tax plan to protect our fragile economy and help Canadian families.,414
We'll continue to make the right choices to keep our budget balanced and taxes low.,414
LOWER TAXES,NA
Our low-tax pledge is rooted in our record:,305
Canadians know that we'll do what we say and that we'll manage taxpayer dollars responsibly.,305
We're prepared to go even further and entrench our low-tax plan in legislation.,414
"Our ''tax lock'' legislation will back our low-tax commitment to families, seniors, workers and small businesses with the force of the law for the next four years.",414
MORE AND BETTER JOBS,NA
Our number one priority is the economy creating jobs and economic growth.,410
Canada has led the G-7 in job creation since 2006 because we've made the right choices.,305
"We've created 1.3 million net new jobs since the depths of the global economic recession,",305
"and our plan will create another 1.3 million new, well-paying jobs by 2020.",410
EXPANDED TRADE,NA
Canada is a trading nation and we've made historic strides to open new markets for Canadian businesses and their workers.,407
The Trans-Pacific Partnership is the largest free trade deal in history.,407
It provides almost 800 million new customers throughout the Asia-Pacific region for Canadian goods and services.,407
"Membership in this agreement is a good deal for Canada, one that will create jobs and opportunities and protect our economy.",407
FAMILY HOME,NA
Homeownership is a key way to support Canadian families.,504
And we're helping more Canadians become homeowners by providing new support to buy and invest in their homes.,504
Now one in seven Canadian households owns their own homes one of the highest rates in the industrialized world.,504
"And, under our plan for affordable, responsible homeownership, we'll aim to add more than 700,000 new homeowners by 2020.",504
SUPPORTING SENIORS,NA
"Canadian seniors deserve our respect and gratitude for a lifetime of hard work in service to our families, our communities, and our country.",504
Our Government has lowered taxes and enhanced benefits to make life more affordable for Canadian seniors.,504
"And, under our plan, single and widowed seniors will get new, major tax relief to help them live their later years in dignity and comfort.",504
These are our priorities:   Keeping our budget balanced.,414
"Lowering taxes on families, seniors, and small businesses.",410
Creating 1.3 million new jobs.,410
Opening new markets for Canadian businessesand workers.,407
"Helping 700,000 more Canadians own their own homes.",706
This is our positive plan to protect Canada's fragile economy and keep it moving forward for the next four years.,410
OUR CONSERVATIVE PLAN FOR A BALANCED BUDGET AND LOW TAXES,NA
"To protect Canada's economy, a re-elected Conservative Government will:   Ensure the federal budget remains balanced",414
Control government spending,414
Keep the tax burden low,414
Continue to reduce Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio,414
Maintain our balanced budget legislation,414
Pass Tax Lock€ legislation to prohibit tax increases in the next four years,414
Budgets don't balance themselves.,305
Canadian families and small business owners understand that.,305
So does our Conservative Government.,305
Keeping Canada's public finances on a solid footing involves hard work and tough choices.,305
And that's what we've done.,305
"Our Conservative Government has controlled spending, lowered taxes, and kept Canada's debt levels the lowest in the G-7 by far.",414
This serves as the fiscal foundation for our plan for Canada's economy.,414
A balanced budget lets us return more money back into the pockets of hard-working families.,414
The federal tax burden is now at its lowest in over half a century.,414
A balanced budget lets us maintain our low debt levels.,414
Low public debt means less taxpayer money dedicated to interest payments and makes it easier for businesses to borrow and invest at a low cost.,410
"A balanced budget lets us make targeted, affordable investments to protect our fragile economy and help families.",414
"This is the basis for our recent enhancement to the monthly Universal Child Care Benefit, our historic infrastructure investment, and the new measures set out in our plan for the next four years.",504
"A balanced budget allows us to protect key programs such as health care and education without having to make deep spending cuts,",504
like previous Liberal governments.,305
A balanced budget ensures that we're not passing on a massive debt burden to our children and grandchildren.,414
It's for these reasons that our Conservative Government has been so committed to balancing the budget.,414
A balanced budget is the anchor for our low-tax plan that's helping Canadian families and protecting Canada's fragile economy.,414
We ran a temporary deficit in 2009 to help protect and create jobs in the face of the worst global economic recession since the 1930s.,409
"But as part of our Economic Action Plan, we also set out a clear, credible plan to return to a balanced budget.",414
And we've been focused on that plan ever since.,414
"Unlike the previous Liberal government,",305
we've continued to increase transfer payments to the provinces and territories for health care and education as we promised.,301
And we've kept taxes low.,414
"Instead, we've eliminated the deficit by controlling government spending,",414
"by eliminating waste and duplication,",303
and by getting rid of outdated or ineffective programs.,303
Our plan is working.,305
We returned to balance in 2014-15 a full year ahead of schedule.,414
"And, according to the Department of Finance, we're on track for the second balanced budget in a row this year.",414
"Canada's sound public finances are the envy of the world, a source of our economic strength, and a re-elected Conservative Government will ensure they remain that way.",305
"Spending beyond our means, as the Liberals and NDP would have us do, would cause structural deficits that would damage our economy,",305
"lead to tax hikes and program cuts,",305
and burden future generations with heavy debt.,305
We need only to look around the world at countries like Greece to see the consequences of profligate and irresponsible spending.,305
"That's not our plan, and not the way forward for Canada.",305
"We'll continue to advance our low-tax, balanced budget plan for jobs and growth,",410
"and we'll continue to operate in the black, spending sensibly within our means and keeping the books balanced.",414
A re-elected Conservative Government will balance the budget every year in the next four years,414
"while keeping taxes low,",410
"increasing transfers to the provinces and territories for health care and education,",301
and making affordable investments to protect the economy and help Canadian families.,410
We'll accomplish this by controlling the growth of direct program spending,414
and maintaining the operating budget freeze for one more year.,414
These steps will provide the fiscal room to make the affordable investments set out in our plan,410
and ensure that the budget remains balanced without raising taxes.,414
Our plan is based on the fiscal projections in the 2015 Budget presented in April.,305
"These projections were based on independent, expert advice from Canada's leading private-sector economists, and include contingencies of up to $3 billion per year to account for the current global economic uncertainty.",305
Put simply: Canadians can count on us to keep the budget balanced and taxes low in the next four years.,414
"We're so committed to these goals, we'll entrench them in law.",414
Our balanced budget legislation ensures that the only acceptable deficit is one that responds to a recession or truly extraordinary circumstances.,414
Deficits outside of these rare scenarios are unacceptable.,414
"A re-elected Conservative Government will follow the Federal Budget Balanced Act to keep spending under control, the budget balanced, and taxes low.",414
We will also continue to reduce Canada's debt burden to meet our debt-to-GDP target of 25 percent by 2021.,414
"Canada now has the lowest debt levels by far among G-7 countries,",414
and we'll make sure our children and grandchildren aren't forced to pay the price for reckless borrowing and spending.,414
Canadians know they can trust us to lower their taxes and keep them low.,305
This is a major point of difference between our Conservative Party and the Liberals and NDP.,305
"These two parties have promised some combination of higher taxes on individuals, families, seniors, and small businesses",305
"€“ including taking away income splitting""",305
and eliminating Tax- Free Savings Accounts in whole or in part.,305
Our low-tax pledge is rooted in our record.,305
Canadians know that we'll do what we say and that we'll manage taxpayer dollars responsibly.,305
"But unlike the Liberals and NDP, we're prepared to go even further and entrench our low-tax plan in legislation.",305
"A re-elected Conservative Government will pass legislation imposing a tax lock€ that prohibits increases to federal personal and business income tax rates, sales tax rates, and discretionary payroll taxes over the next four years.",414
This pledge backs our low-tax commitment with the force of the law.,414
AT RISK,NA
Our Conservative Government is the only party in this election with a clear plan to keep the budget balanced and taxes low.,305
"Not only do we have a clear track record, but we're putting forward new measures to ensure the budget stays balanced and the tax burden continues to fall.",305
"The Liberals and NDP have put forward plans to run large, permanent deficits, hike taxes on workers, families, and small businesses, and leave our economy exposed.",305
"They'll do this by:   Adding billions of dollars in new spending, running ongoing, permanent deficits, and accumulating billions more in debt.",305
Repealing our balanced budget legislation so they can run deficits without being accountable to Canadians.,305
Putting important programs like health care and education at risk as a result of their reckless and irresponsible spending.,305
"Eliminating the Family Tax Cut which is providing up to $2,000 in tax relief for 1.7 million families.",305
"Taking away the monthly Universal Child-Care Benefit which is providing nearly $2,000 per year for children under age 6, and more than $700 per year for children aged 6 to 17.",305
The UCCB goes to all the nearly four million families with children.,305
Shutting down Tax-Free Savings Accounts which are helping 11 million Canadians save and grow their savings tax-free.,305
Cancelling Pension Income Splitting which is providing one million senior couples with more than $1 billion annual tax relief.,305
"Hiking payroll taxes as much as $1,000 per year for someone making $60,000 on Canadian workers and small businesses.",305
"Driving up the price of everything Canadian families buy including gasoline, groceries, and home heating fuel by imposing carbon pricing schemes on the Canadian economy.",305
OUR CONSERVATIVE PLAN FOR A STRONGER ECONOMY,NA
"To protect our economy and create jobs, a re-elected Conservative Government will:   Aim to create 1.3 million new jobs by 2020",410
Cut taxes on small businesses from 11 to 9 percent,402
Lower payroll taxes on small businesses and workers by more than 20 percent,402
Implement the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement,407
Provide new incentives for manufacturers to purchase equipment,411
and invest in new technologies,411
Grant tax relief to businesses that hire apprentices,411
"As much of the rest of the world continues to struggle with the fallout from the recent global financial recession, Canada has emerged in a position of relative strength.",305
We have one of the best job-creation records in the G-7.,305
"Indeed, since the depths of the global recession, 1.3 million net new jobs mostly well-paying, full-time positions in the private sector have been created.",305
That's more Canadians working than before the recession.,305
That's more Canadians working than ever before in our country's history.,305
And it's so much more than just a number.,410
"With every job created, there's another Canadian who knows the dignity of supporting his or her family, and another family with a brighter future.",410
"Having a good job is the difference between worrying about today and dreaming about tomorrow which is why the creation of new, well-paying jobs for Canadians will continue to be our top priority.",410
The best way to ensure more and better jobs is to create the right conditions for our enterprising businesses to do what they do best.,410
"Businesses create jobs and opportunities that make our economy stronger, and the new products and ideas that make our lives better.",410
"That means continuing with our Conservative plan to balance the budget, keep taxes and debt low,",414
"open new markets for Canadians products,",407
"make smart, affordable investments in the economy,",410
and support entrepreneurs and small businesses as they hire and grow.,410
Keeping our budget balanced,414
and lowering taxes on small businesses is the right way for government to protect Canada's fragile economy and create jobs.,402
The other parties have a different vision.,305
"The Liberals and NDP believe that they can raise taxes, run deficits, and accumulate more government debt without killing jobs.",305
"But all you have to do is look around the world to see the consequences of that type of high-tax, high-debt agenda.",305
It saps small business ingenuity and diminishes the reward for innovation and hard-work.,305
It punishes success and discourages entrepreneurs from entering the market.,305
"It chokes off job creation and, ultimately, wrecks economies.",305
"In Canada, it would mean more Canadians out of work and looking for jobs.",305
Canadians simply can't afford the high-tax agenda of the Liberals and NDP.,305
"The path forward is clear: only a re-elected Conservative Government will continue to implement its low-tax, balanced budget plan to protect Canada's economy",414
and create jobs.,410
This is the right path.,305
It's working.,305
And we intend to keep moving forward.,305
A re-elected Conservative Government will build on our job-creation record by implementing a positive plan to create 1.3 million net new jobs by 2020.,410
KEEPING TAXES LOW,NA
"We understand that keeping taxes low helps small businesses to grow and create new, well-paying jobs.",410
"Because of our low-tax, balanced budget plan for jobs and economic growth, Canada has the lowest overall tax rate on new business investment of all the major advanced economies,",410
and our tax rate on small businesses continues to fall.,410
Canada is now often cited as one of the best countries in the world in which to do business.,410
A re-elected Conservative Government will maintain and build on this low-tax record.,402
We will not raise taxes on the businesses that create jobs for Canadians or on Canadian workers.,402
Our tax lock€ legislation will prohibit income and sales tax rate increases and discretionary payroll tax hikes on Canadian businesses and workers for the next four years.,402
"Instead, we will carry out our plan to lower the tax rate on small businesses which we've already lowered from 13 percent to 11 percent another two percentage points, to nine percent, by 2019.",402
This is the largest reduction in the small business tax rate in a quarter century.,402
The Liberals and NDP have promised to raise payroll taxes on workers and small businesses by billions of dollars.,305
"But we know that lower payroll taxes encourage small businesses to hire more Canadians, and to pay them higher wages.",410
That's why we've worked so hard to keep those taxes down.,305
Our low-tax record is clear.,305
We have kept payroll taxes low,402
"and in 2014 we created the two-year Small Business Job Credit to provide more than $550 million in payroll tax relief for 780,000 job-creating businesses across the country.",402
A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to lower these taxes.,402
"Beginning in 2017, when the current freeze on EI premiums expires, we will lower them by more than 20 percent a substantial benefit to Canadian small businesses and workers.",402
"Our small businesses will be able to hire even more workers, and for 16 million Canadian workers, it'll mean a significant salary raise.",402
We're the only party - the only ones that can be trusted - to keep taxes low on small businesses and their workers for the next four years.,305
OPENING MARKETS FOR CANADIAN BUSINESSES,NA
"From the days of the French and British traders who first laid the foundations of our modern economy, Canada has been a trading nation.",407
Trade is the lifeblood of our economy.,407
"It accounts for 60 percent of our GDP, and one in five Canadian jobs.",407
Canadian businesses and workers know instinctively that we can compete with the world's best as long as the playing field is level.,407
We also know that we're better off when our goods and services can reach global markets without barriers and restrictions.,407
Yet previous governments failed Canadians when it came to negotiating trade access for Canadian products.,305
"While other countries were busy signing free-trade deals and receiving preferential access to important markets, the Liberals weren't even at the negotiating table.",305
And Canadian businesses and workers suffered.,305
Our Conservative Government has reversed this inaction and opened up new markets for Canadian products and services.,407
When we took office Canada had free trade agreements with only five other countries.,305
"We've now reached agreements with 44, countries, encompassing more than half the global marketplace, including historic trade deals with South Korea and the European Union, with its 500-million person, $18-trillion economy.",407
These agreements have given Canadian businesses and their workers access to more than half the global marketplace.,407
Yet there's more to accomplish.,407
"In the past few days we have concluded the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement with 11 other founding countries, including the United States, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.",407
The TPP is the largest free trade deal in history.,407
It gives  greater access for Canadian goods and services to almost 800 million consumers throughout the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region.,407
It's a great deal for Canada that will significantly benefit our economy and Canadians' prosperity.,407
"The TPP will protect and create jobs,",407
"grow Canada's economy,",407
and provide financial security to workers and businesses in all regions of the country.,407
"It guarantees preferential access for Canadian goods and services in a range of sectors including agriculture and agri-food, fish and seafood, forestry, metals and mining, and manufactured industrial goods.",407
"The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a historic agreement that will protect and create jobs, and grow Canada's economy now and in the future.",407
That's why a re-elected Conservative Government will ratify and implement the TPP.,407
"As part of the TPP negotiations, we've defended and protected Canada's supply management system, as we committed to.",407
We've limited access to only three and one quarter percent of our dairy market.,703
And we've announced key programs to ensure Canada's supply-managed sectors -- and the communities that depend on them -- continue to thrive.,703
"To ensure stability for supply-managed farmers through the implementation of our trade agreements, we've established long-term income and quota guarantee programs.",703
"And we're supporting investment in cutting-edge technologies for our processing sector and marketing of world-class Canadian products, which are of the highest quality.",411
Free trade only works when it's also fair and this means a modern and effective system of remedy when a Canadian company has been treated unjustly.,407
A re-elected Conservative Government will take steps to modernize our system and ensure that it's comparable with the practices and policies of our main trading partners.,407
To this end we'll:   Mandate the Canada Border Services Agency to carry out a full investigation of trade complaints even in cases when preliminary reviews by the Canadian International Trade Tribunal come back negative.,407
"Require the Canadian International Trade Tribunal to carry out an automatic five-year review of every finding of non-compliance, to ensure the conflict has been resolved in a satisfactory manner.",407
"Continue to work with stakeholders such as the Canadian Steel Producers Association to ensure that the system is effective and accessible, and ultimately creates a level-playing field for Canadian businesses.",407
The federal government provides a wide range of programs and services to firms looking to invest in Canada and to Canadian businesses trying to sell their goods and services abroad.,407
These initiatives help attract investment and job creation in Canada,407
and support export-oriented Canadian businesses in their search for new market opportunities and new customers.,407
"There remains, however, room for improvement.",403
The system can be difficult for small firms to navigate.,403
Government efforts to attract investment and promote job creation can sometimes be stymied by a lack of coordination.,407
"A re-elected Conservative Government will establish an Investment and Trade Promotion Office with a mandate to coordinate the government's various efforts to encourage businesses in other countries to invest in Canada,",407
and to promote Canadian exports abroad.,407
The Office will be a one-stop shop to attract investment and product mandates to Canada,407
and help growing Canadian businesses enter new markets.,407
CUTTING RED TAPE,NA
"Small businesses should be focused on creating jobs, not filling out paperwork.",303
That's why our Conservative Government has made it a priority to reduce bureaucratic red tape.,303
We've passed world-leading One-for- One€ legislation that requires bureaucrats to eliminate a current regulation before establishing a new one.,303
We've taken steps to harmonize Canadian regulations with those of our major trading partners.,407
And we've improved the way we consult with small business owners about government policy.,303
"The result of all this is a dramatic change in the culture of the federal government, putting unprecedented emphasis on the needs of Canadian small businesses.",303
And the benefits so far are clear: Small businesses are now spending $32 million less sorting through regulatory red tape.,303
That's hundreds of thousands of working hours Canadians are now spending building their businesses instead of filling out forms.,303
But there's always more that can be done.,303
"A re-elected Conservative Government will build on this record by:   Launching a new round of consultations, asking small business owners across the country for feedback on our current reforms and suggestions for future measures.",303
"Expanding the red tape baseline,€ increasing significantly the scope of the red tape burden subject to the One-for-One rule.",303
"And with a more comprehensive baseline, challenging ourselves to reduce the overall burden by 20 percent.",303
"We'll achieve this goal while maintaining the highest standards in all areas, including health and safety.",303
"To achieve our 20 percent target we will take short-term, immediate action to cut red tape in ways that are real, measureable and meaningful to Canadians.",303
We'll work with the Retail Council of Canada to better harmonize Canada's child car seat regulations with the United States.,303
"This will reduce the red tape burden for our retailers,",303
and at the same time allow them to offer greater choice and better prices to Canadian parents with young families.,401
"And we'll make life easier for the 1.2 million Canadians who claim home-office expense deductions, 80 percent of whom are self-employed.",504
"Anyone who makes a claim once will be able to use the same cost estimates, adjusted for inflation, in subsequent years.",303
MANUFACTURING STRATEGY,NA
"In a fast-changing world, here's one thing that hasn't changed: Canada's manufacturing sector is absolutely vital to our growing economy.",410
"It accounts for about 11 percent of our GDP, 61 percent of Canadian exports, and provides good, secure jobs to almost 1.7 million Canadians across the country.",410
"Indirectly, it employs many millions more.",410
Manufacturing firms pay out $1.85 billion weekly in salaries to Canadian workers across the country.,410
But what is changing is the nature of the work.,411
"It's becoming more skilled, more specialized, and more globally competitive.",411
"Liberal leader Justin Trudeau says that manufacturing's time is passed, that it's time for Canada to transition away€ from manufacturing.",305
Our Conservative Government disagrees.,305
"Manufacturing has played a key role in Canada's economy since before Confederation and, with the right plan, will continue to sustain high-quality, high-paying jobs and economic activity across the country.",410
Our Conservative Government has a positive plan to sustain our manufacturing sector.,410
We're:   Lowering taxes to make it easier for manufacturers to invest in advanced technology and equipment.,411
Helping Canadians acquire the skills and training they need to take advantage of new opportunities in manufacturing.,411
Opening new markets for manufacturers to find customers and sell their products.,407
Making strategic investments to encourage research and development and the creation of new products and technologies.,411
This is what our manufacturing strategy is all about.,305
And it's working.,305
Manufacturing wages are up nearly 20 percent since we've come to office.,410
But there's more to be done to support what the Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters have called our manufacturing renaissance.€,410
"Manufacturers need to invest in new machinery and equipment to remain globally competitive, expand their businesses, and create good new jobs.",410
"To help with this, we've reduced taxes steadily on these investments.",402
A re-elected Conservative Government will carry out our ten-year plan to lower the tax burden on Canadian manufacturers that acquire the machinery and equipment they need to succeed.,402
"Canada is attracting high-quality, value-added manufacturing investment.",410
But more can be done to bolster advanced manufacturing across the country.,410
"A re-elected Conservative Government will support a new Advanced Manufacturing Hub in partnership with employers, our colleges and universities, and other stakeholders to encourage the development of new cutting-edge products and technologies.",402
"The new center, located in Southwestern Ontario, will become a catalyst for high-quality, value-added investment and jobs in the manufacturing sector.",402
"A re-elected Conservative Government will establish a $100-million Manufacturing Technology Demonstration Fund to support large-scale, cutting-edge manufacturing projects in the developmental, pre-commercial stages.",402
This fund will build on our existing significant investments in science and technology to make Canada a world leader in new manufacturing technologies.,411
"We'll also renew the Automotive Innovation Fund for ten years, beginning in 2018-19, at baseline funding of $100 million per year.",402
"This will help to create a stable, predictable environment for new automotive investment in Canada.",402
"In addition, we'll change the program's parameters in the immediate term to include bricks and mortar as eligible expenses",402
and offer grants rather than repayable loans for greenfield investments and investments in existing facilities that guarantee a long-term presence and operation.,402
"We still believe the phrase ""Made in Canada"" translates well around the world: It means high-quality goods built by highly skilled workers, and it inspires confidence that a product is the very best.",601
"And on our watch, Canada will never turn away from this legacy of excellence.¸",601
SKILLS TRAINING FOR NEW AND BETTER JOBS,NA
"A big part of our Conservative Government's agenda has been providing support to those Canadians looking to upgrade their skills for a new job,",411
"enter the skilled trades,",411
or obtain credential recognition for their international training.,411
Having the right skills is often the key to finding a new job or getting a pay raise.,411
"As part of this agenda, our Government has always made a priority of supporting apprenticeships and Canadians working in the skilled trades.",411
"These are the people who are literally building this great country,",411
and one estimate predicts that Canada will need one million more skilled workers by 2020.,411
One measure we've taken to help young Canadians launch careers in the skilled trades is the Apprenticeship Job Creation Tax Credit.,411
"The program has been a resounding success, with the number of businesses using this tax credit rising six fold from about 2,000 to almost 12,000 and nearly 68,000 apprentices.",411
"To build on this success, and to encourage more employers to create more jobs for the next generation of skilled workers, a re-elected Conservative Government will take further steps to support those who wish to enter the skilled trades",411
and to help Canadians wishing to update their skills for a new or better-paying jobs.,411

"Canada is a beacon of freedom and prosperity to people all around the world,",601
and attracts countless immigrants every year seeking a better place to raise their families and pursue their dreams.,601
"But too often they find it challenging to pursue their careers here because of difficulties having their professional credentials recognized, leaving them under-employed and unable to maximize both their own potential and their contribution to our country.",503
"In fact, this problem costs the Canadian economy about $2 billion every year.",503
Our Government has worked hard to help new Canadians in this position.,503
In 2011 we launched a pilot program that provided loans to support new Canadians who needed help with training and licensing to have their international credentials recognized here in Canada.,411
"It was a significant success, distributing 2,000 loans across the country and recovering more than 99 percent of the money lent.",411
"So in Economic Action Plan 2015, we made this program permanent.",411
"A re-elected Conservative Government will build on this success story by doubling the size of the program,",411
"and setting a goal of providing as many as 20,000 foreign credential recognition loans over the next four years.",411
"We'll also work with the provinces and territories, through the Pan-Canadian Framework for the Assessment and Recognition of Foreign Qualifications,",301
"to improve the service standards for accreditation decisions for target, high-demand occupations under the Framework from one year to 60 days.",411
The Canada Job Grant is the most important reform to federal skills-training program in decades.,411
The new Canada Job Grant helps employers train new or existing employees for jobs that need to be filled.,411
"It's providing federal grants of up to $10,000 per worker for skills upgrades, on the condition that the training is tied to new or better jobs.",411
The program is working.,305
"Nearly 50,000 grants have been funded to date.",411
A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to support the Canada Job Grant,411
and consider ways to build on its success in other job-training programs.,411

"While our government has welcomed a record number of newcomers, we have also strengthened the integrity of our immigration system,",605
"cracking down on those who would abuse Canada's generosity by:   Adopting the Cracking Down on Crooked Immigration Consultants Act,",605
and designating a stronger new regulatory body for immigration consultants.,605
"Combatting immigration marriage fraud with a two-year residency requirement, which has resulted in a significant decline in commercial marriages of convenience.",605

as the backlog and processing times continue to decrease.,303
SPURRING INNOVATION AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,NA
The marketplace is dynamic.,410
Canadian businesses grow and succeed by staying ahead of the competition.,410
"This means adopting new technologies and developing new goods, services, and processes.",411
Staying ahead means never growing complacent and always innovating.,411
"Our Conservative Government has helped Canadian businesses invest and grow through targeted tax relief,",402

"Investing in ongoing support for the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council.",411
CREATING OPPORTUNITY FOR CANADA'S FARMERS,NA
It's no exaggeration to say that the family farm is the foundation of the Canada we love today.,703
"The products have evolved, the markets have changed, and the technology has advanced, but some things remain constant: From before the sun comes up to long after it goes down, farmers across Canada do the backbreaking work that feeds the country.",703
"The work is hard, and financially risky but absolutely vital to Canadians.",703
It's also vital to our economy.,703
"The agriculture and agri-food sectors account for more than $100 billion in economic activity every year,",703
and employ more than two million Canadians.,703
The importance of agriculture to our national interest can't be overstated.,703
And our Conservative Government's support for farmers is unwavering.,703
A significant part of our support for the sector has been dedicated to innovation and crop science.,703
"Our Government has consistently supported strategic research and development by industry into agricultural technologies, processes, practices and services research that drives growth and creates jobs and opportunities in the industry by making it more sustainable and more globally competitive.",703
The projects we are supporting are as diverse as the industry itself.,703
"The Agri-Innovation program, for instance, has been used to develop pest-management tools in the blueberry industry;",703
"to find new and innovative ways to turn food by-products into environmentally friendly, value-added goods;",703
"and to increase the competitiveness of our food-processing industry while making our food better, healthier, and safer.",703
"A re-elected Conservative Government will increase funding to the Agri-Innovation program by $100 million over three years,",703
and make projects driven by universities and colleges eligible for financing.,703
Our farmers and their produce can compete with the best in the world.,703
Our Government has been there to help them enter global markets and find new customers.,703
We established the Market Access Secretariat in 2009 to serve as a single-window to help Canadian farmers with trade-related issues.,703
We've hired trade commissioners dedicated to agriculture issues.,703
And we've co-funded marketing activities with industry to enhance Canada's agricultural presence in priority markets.,703
"A re-elected Conservative Government will increase support for the Agri-Marketing Program to help promote Canada's agricultural and agri-food products around the world, building on our international reputation for excellence",703
and increasing the visibility of the Canadian brand in important markets.,703
We'll also continue to expand the activities of the Market Access Secretariat to help Canadian farmers diversify into new markets.,703
"As we open new markets for agricultural products, we'll continue to stand up for Canadian farmers and industries by defending our system of supply management in all international forums and trade negotiations.",703
We understand that market access also requires a robust transportation system with fair rules and accountabilities.,411
Our Government passed the Fair Rail for Grain Farmers Act in May 2014 to provide more certainty and better service standards with respect to grain volumes for farmers and shippers.,703
"We also launched a broader review of our transportation system to determine what policy changes should be made to address key issues facing the transportation sector, including ensuring Canada's supply chains have the capacity, flexibility and resiliency to meet future demands.",411
"The review panel, led by the Honourable David Emerson, will provide recommendations to the government later this year.",411
A re-elected Conservative Government will take action to improve Canada's transportation network,411
"and support market access for Canadian farmers, based upon the recommendations of the transportation review.",703
PROMOTING CANADA'S FISHERIES,NA
Commercial fishing has been a pillar of the Canadian economy since the 16th century.,703
"Today, Canada's commercial fishery employs, directly and indirectly, about 80,000 Canadians, and exports about $5 billion worth of fish and other seafood every year.",703
"Our Government has a strong record of supporting Canadians who make their living on the water, and is committed to the continued success of this industry and the prosperity of the Canadians it employs.",703
Among our accomplishments are:   New measures targeting fish harvesters who are not compliant with the Preserving the Independence of the Inshore Fleet in Canada's Atlantic Fisheries Policy.,703
Ongoing maintenance and upgrades to Canada's small craft harbours including more than 250 small craft harbour improvement projects planned over the next two years.,703
Establishing and expanding the Recreational Fisheries Conservation Partnerships Program to conserve and protect Canada's recreational fisheries.,501
The program has funded nearly 300 conservation projects across the country to date.,501
"A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to build on these initiatives with a focus on science,",411
"marine conservation,",501
and promoting Canadian products in new markets including through the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,407
"Canada's most important commercial fishery is lobster, with exports generating more than $1 billion a year.",703
"It has supported Canadian fishing families for more than a century, and plays a substantial role in the economies of coastal communities in Atlantic Canada and Quebec.",703
"Our Government has seen the lobster fishery through good times and bad, including investing significant funds through the Community Adjustment Fund-Lobster Initiative and the Short- Term Transitional Measures Program to help the industry through the global recession.",703
"And the Atlantic Lobster Sustainability Measures Program provided support for restructuring and rationalization,",703
as well as conservation and stewardship programs to support the long-term sustainability of the industry.,501
We'll continue these efforts.,703
A re-elected Conservative Government will fund a new lobster branding initiative to be carried out in co-operation with the Lobster Council of Canada.,703
This measure will support the Council's work promoting the Canada Lobster Brand both here at home and in export markets around the world.,703
We'll also pursue new markets for Canadian lobster.,703
"A re-elected Conservative Government will also work in collaboration with the provinces and the University of Prince Edward Island's AVC Lobster Science Centre to pursue biomass research, gaining valuable information that will inform policy decisions affecting the lobster fishery for years to come.",703
We'll also support the Atlantic salmon fishery by confronting Greenland on the issue of overfishing Canada's Atlantic salmon stock,703
"and increasing the harvest of striped bass to improve the survival of juvenile Atlantic salmon, following receipt of an upcoming Department of Fisheries and Oceans scientific study.",501
"Our sealing industry is of vital importance to many coastal communities, in particular among Canada's Aboriginal peoples.",705
"A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to pursue new and expanded markets for these products, including establishing a system of certification to demonstrate that products resulting from Aboriginal hunting meet European Union standards.",407
"As part of the completion of the Canada-EU Free Trade Agreement, we've committed to working with the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador",301
to provide support for those affected by the elimination of minimum processing requirements (MPRs) in the fishery sector.,703
A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to work with the province to provide compensation for losses arising from the gradual elimination of these requirements.,410
We have set aside $280 million ($93 million per year over 3 years) for this purpose which is intended to be matched 70:30 by the province.,410
"In the event that we cannot reach an agreement with the province to deliver a joint compensation program, we'll compensate workers directly who have been negatively impacted by MPR phase-outs.",504
SUPPORTING CANADA'S FORESTRY SECTOR AND ITS WORKERS,NA
"Our great forests are among the features that define us most as a country, and our forestry industry has been a source of prosperity since before Confederation.",601
"Today, the industry supports more than 200,000 Canadian families, and contributes $20 billion to our national GDP.",410
"And, we're proud to say, our industry sets the gold standard for environmentally-friendly forest managment.",501
More than 160 million hectares of Canadian forest are managed by companies that have been independently certified for their progressive and sustainable management practices.,501
"In fact, almost half of all the forests in the world that are managed to this standard are in Canada four times more than our nearest competitor.",501
And this hasn't gone unnoticed.,501
A 2014 survey of international wood and wood products buyers found that Canada's forestry industry had the best environmental reputation in the world.,501
"Still, there are some groups who continue to spread falsehoods among our industry's customers about Canadian forestry practices,",305
sabotaging businesses,305
and hurting the hardworking Canadians who take pride in their industry.,305
"Mills have closed, and Canadians have lost their jobs because of these actions.",305
"A re-elected Conservative Government will help Canada's forestry industry fight back by establishing a fund to match private-sector contributions to promote Canadian forestry products and our sustainable management practices, and to counter those who are conducting misinformation campaigns.",402
This new commitment builds upon other steps we intend to take to help support Canada's forestry sector and its workers:   A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to pursue untapped market opportunities to expand and diversify our export markets both here in North America and around the world.,407
This includes renegotiating an agreement to allow our softwood lumber exports to enter the United States market.,407
"We'll continue to encourage the growth and modernization of the industry through the Forest Innovation Program, which supports research and development.",411
"And we'll continue investing in the Forest Industry Transportation Program, which supports the development of new technologies that make our forestry industry more efficient and more environmentally friendly.",411
EXPANDING NEW MINING OPPORTUNITIES,NA
Canada is a global leader in the mining sector.,410
"From Yukon's gold to Labrador's iron, the industry provides almost 400,000 Canadians across the country with jobs that, for the most part, are the highest-paying industrial jobs in the country.",410
"It's the main business for 150 communities in rural and northern Canada,",410
"and employs the largest number, proportionally, of Aboriginal Canadians of any industry.",705
We're committed to ensuring this vital sector remains a source of jobs and opportunity for Canadians for generations to come.,410
The Mineral Exploration Tax Credit has helped junior mining companies raise more than $5.5 billion for exploration since 2006.,402
"In 2013 alone, more than 250 companies used the credit to raise financing from 19,000 individual investors.",402
A re-elected Conservative Government will extend the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit for three years to support further mining exploration and investment.,402
"Meanwhile, the development of hundreds of potential mining projects in this great, vast country such as the Ring of Fire in Northern Ontario and Plan Nord in Quebec is challenged by the high cost of working far from transportation routes and supply centres.",410
Many of these ventures could be economic game-changers for the Canadians living in the surrounding regions.,410
A re-elected Conservative Government will support economic development in these communities by establishing an enhanced Mining Exploration Tax Credit for northern and remote mining projects.,402
These new commitments build on our current plan to support Canada's mining sector.,402
"A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to support jobs and growth in the mining industry by following through on our plan to invest further in the Targeted Geoscience Initiative, to promote increased mineral exploration by the private sector.",402
We'll also expand the eligible costs under the Canadian Exploration Expenses policy to include environmental studies,501
and community consultations.,202
RESPONSIBLE RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT,NA
"Canada is one of the world's great energy suppliers, providing the world with everything from oil and natural gas to coal, uranium, and biofuels.",408
"Not surprisingly, then, the energy industry is more than a source of power.",410
"Directly and indirectly providing good jobs for more than 900,000 Canadians,",410
"and accounting for almost one third of our merchandise exports,",410
it's also a significant source of opportunity and prosperity.,410
"But even those who don't make a living in the energy industry benefit in real, substantial ways from its success.",410
It contributes billions of dollars every year that governments spend on the programs and services that Canadians depend upon.,410
"A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to support this crucial industry, and the many Canadians who depend on it for their livelihoods.",410
"This means not interfering in the independent project review process,",401
and making final decisions on individual projects based on the science and recommendations of expert bodies.,411
"Canada is home to vast reserves of natural gas, a resource that holds immense potential for jobs and growth for generations to come if it can be exported to meet the ever-growing demands of countries in the Asia-Pacific region.",410
"The most efficient way to do this is to transport it in liquefied form, which means establishing facilities to process our natural gas for shipping.",410
"A re-elected Conservative Government will follow through with its plan to support the creation of a Liquefied Natural Gas industry,",402
helping investors meet their start-up costs by offering an accelerated Capital Cost Allowance on machinery and equipment used in processing facilities.,402
Our Government has a strong record of co-funding investments in pre-commercial clean technology projects to help bring them to market.,501
These investments are good for the environment and good for our economy.,501
"A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to support Sustainable Development Technology Canada's work to finance the development and demonstration of new, clean technologies that create efficiencies for businesses and contribute to sustainable economic development.",501
BUILDING ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE,NA
The founders of Confederation bound our country together with a great railway because they knew a country of this size could not function without significant investments in infrastructure.,411
It's no different today.,411
"From highways, airports and harbours to subways, bridges and community facilities, infrastructure projects create good jobs for tens of thousands of Canadians,",411
"drive our economy,",410
"improve our quality of life,",503
and connect us to each other.,411
"More than 95 percent of Canada's core public infrastructure is owned by provinces, territories, and municipalities",411
"but, since 2006, our Conservative Government has made a historic commitment to supporting public infrastructure across the country.",411
"We promised in 2006 a better approach to fixing Canada's infrastructure deficit,€ and we've delivered.",305
Federal support for infrastructure has increased dramatically under our Government.,411
Annual federal funding has increased from $571 million a decade ago to over $5 billion this year.,411
"And we have launched the largest, longest-running infrastructure program in Canadian history.",411
"Altogether, our investments in infrastructure for the years 2013-2023 will total almost $85 billion.",411
"This level of investment is without precedent, and we've accomplished it while bringing the budget back into balance and lowering taxes.",414
"Infrastructure is also key to trade, and Canadian products need modern infrastructure to travel efficiently to their final destinations at home and abroad.",411
"Our Government has made historic investments in improving our trade-oriented infrastructure such as ports, harbours, and rail.",411
"Improvements include major projects at Port Metro Vancouver, the Port of Quebec, the Port of Montreal, the Saint John Harbour Bridge, and the new Gordie Howe International Bridge between Windsor and Detroit.",411
A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to support important economic investments such as these across the country.,411
"We'll launch the Quebec Maritime Prosperity Initiative to fund maritime and port infrastructure including improvements to facilities for cruise ships and tall ships, such as the Quai Alexandra terminal in Montreal, the Ross Gaudreault terminal in Quebec City, and the restoration of Champlain Foulon sector promenade.",411
"We'll fund key Asia-Pacific Gateway projects in Western Canada to strengthen our transport system and help Canadian businesses, including our farmers, get their products to market.",411
"And we'll support major public transit projects such as Smart Track in the Greater Toronto Area, Light Rail Transit in Surrey and Ottawa, and Calgary's Green Line to fight gridlock,",411
"reduce travel times for commuters and businesses,",411
and support new economic development.,410
Governing is about making choices.,305
"We have chosen to keep taxes low,",414
"balance the books,",414
and invest in infrastructure because we know that these things are good for our economy and good for Canadians.,411
"A re-elected Conservative government will continue to invest in core public infrastructure, to keep our economy moving forward, and to make life easier and better for Canadians.",411
"High-speed internet access is not just a quality-of-life issue it's critical infrastructure that contributes to business investment, job creation, and, ultimately, economic development in rural and remote parts of our country.",411
Our Conservative Government has put significant effort and investments into extending high-speed broadband access to all Canadians.,411
"Our goal is to ensure that 98 percent of Canadian households have high-speed internet service by 2017, and we're on track to meet this target.",411
"A re-elected Conservative Government will build on our record of expanding rural internet access by funding high-capacity backbone such as fibre optic cable networks or satellite in hundreds of communities across the country,",411
allowing people and businesses in northern and rural communities to access the internet at speeds currently enjoyed by Canadians in larger urban centres.,411
SUPPORTING NORTHERN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT,NA
"Canadians are a northern people; winter blows through our stories, our songs, and our sports.",601
And the Arctic itself is a key element of our national identity.,601
"Its exploration, by great heroes like Sir John Franklin, is our history.",601
Its vast geography is our present.,601
And its limitless promise is our future.,601
One of the challenges of living in Canada's north is the high cost of healthy food.,504
"The great distance between major shipping hubs and some of our most remote communities drives up prices, making feeding a family a much more expensive undertaking than in the rest of the country.",504
"Our Conservative Government is committed to helping people in Northern communities enjoy the kind of healthy diet all Canadians enjoy,",504
"and has invested significantly in the Nutrition North program, which subsidizes the cost of food shipped to communities in northern Canada.",504
But the program can be improved.,504
A re-elected Conservative Government will require that all retailers have a point-of-sale system for the Nutrition North program so that Northern customers can clearly see on their grocery receipts how and when the Nutrition North subsidy is applied.,403
We'll also extend the Nutrition North Program to 40 additional communities.,504
A key part of Canada's Northern Strategy is the devolution of power related to lands and resources to northern governments.,301
"In Yukon and the Northwest Territories, which have reached agreements with the federal government to achieve this, significant prosperity, growth and opportunity have followed.",410
€“ it's about giving the people of the North more say in their own future," and greater control over their own destiny."""
A re-elected Conservative Government will commit to completing the devolution of land and resource powers to the Government of Nunavut over the next four years.,301
A strong and prosperous North is key to a strong and prosperous Canada.,410
"This is why our Government has worked hard to promote economic development in the North through an unprecedented number of important investments in infrastructure, including airports, marine facilities, and roads.",411
These investments benefit Northerners in real and significant ways.,411
"First, making it more efficient to transport goods brings down prices, and lower prices make it easier to live, work and raise a family in the North.",411
"Second, investments in infrastructure create new jobs and opportunities for Northerners.",411
Better infrastructure also improves Northerners' quality of life by making it easier and safer to get around.,411
"A re-elected Conservative Government will build on its record of infrastructure investment by improving the section of Highway 5 running through Wood Buffalo National Park and connecting Hay River to Fort Smith, NWT widening it, replacing drainage culverts, and hard-surfacing the last 68-kilometre stretch that currently remains a gravel road.",411
A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to support the Strategic Investments in Northern Economic Development program to finance economic development projects in the territories.,402
And we'll also continue to support the Northern Project Management Office to foster a more stable and attractive investment climate for resource development in the territories.,402
AT RISK,NA
"Our low-tax, balanced budget plan has protected Canada's economy in the face of global economic turmoil.",414
Canada's economic growth and job-creation record has been world-leading but conditions remain fragile and external risks threaten our financial security.,414
"Now is not the time to take our country in the wrong direction a direction we know would expose our fragile economy,",414
"cost Canadians money,",414
and put their jobs at risk.,414
"Given the chance, the Liberals and NDP would expose Canada's fragile economy by:   Raising general taxes on job-creating businesses by billions of dollars.",305
Hiking payroll taxes on small businesses by billions more.,305
Imposing billions of dollars in carbon taxes on Canadian businesses that will put them at a major competitive disadvantage,305
and raise the price of everything for Canadian consumers.,305
Abandoning efforts to open up new markets for Canadian products.,305
Blocking resource development so that Canada's energy resources will stay in the ground instead of being developed responsibly to generate investment and jobs.,305
Siding with environmental special interest groups at the expense of Canada's forestry and mining sectors and their workers.,305
Re-establishing the Canadian Wheat Board monopoly to limit choice and opportunity for Western grain farmers.,305
Running up budget deficits,305
"and accumulating significant new debt that will undermine investor confidence,",305
"set Canada's economy back,",305
and impose a heavy burden on future generations.,305
OUR CONSERVATIVE PLAN FOR HARD-WORKING FAMILIES AND SENIORS,NA
"To protect our economy and help families, a re-elected Conservative Government will:   Establish a new, permanent Home Renovation Tax Credit",504

Double grants for low- and middle-income families saving for their children's education,506
Provide new tax relief for single and widowed seniors,504
Expand grants for families with disabled children,504
"Families are the bedrock of our communities, and, by extension, our country.",603

It's always been our goal to make Canada the best country in the world in which to raise a family.,603
"Now raising a family is hard work, and we believe it's work best left to the experts: Mom and Dad.",603
"We believe that in a Canada of low taxes, good jobs, safe streets and the opportunity to prosper, they can do the rest and that's what we're delivering.",603
"That's why, when it comes to taxes, our Conservative Government is committed to taking as little as possible, and giving back as much as we can especially to lower- and middle-income families.",503
"In fact, the federal tax burden is now at the lowest level in over 50 years.",503
This principle has been at the heart of our Conservative Government's agenda since taking office.,503
It's why we:   Lowered the GST from seven to six to five percent.,503
"Established, and then enhanced, the monthly Universal Child-Care Benefit.",504
Provided tax relief for families who put their children in sports and arts programs.,502
"Granted tax relief for scholarships, bursaries, and textbooks to Canadian students.",506
Extended tax relief for public transit users.,504
Brought in Pension Income Splitting and other new tax relief for Canadian seniors.,505
Enacted and expanded Tax-Free Savings Accounts.,402
"Introduced the $2,000 Family Tax Cut for families with children.",505
"As a result of our Conservative plan, the typical Canadian family now has more than $6,600 in their pockets every year real benefits, real relief, that they can count on.",505
"We understand the financial pressure that families face, and we're focused on helping these families make ends meet.",505
"Our plan leaves every family with children with more money in their pockets to spend on their priorities,",505
and the long-term financial security to pursue those priorities with confidence.,505
"We want every family to succeed,",505
and we'll help by lowering their taxes and giving them the freedom to choose what's best for them.,505
And that's what a re-elected Conservative Government will continue to do.,505
"We'll pass legislation imposing a tax lock€ on increases to federal income tax rates and sales tax rates, and discretionary payroll taxes over the next four years.",505
This pledge backs our low-tax commitment with the force of the law.,505
THE FAMILY HOME,NA
"For most Canadians, the family home is their biggest asset and their most significant investment in their future financial security.",706
"It's also the focus of their lives where they raise their children, relax with friends and family, and enjoy their golden years.",706
"That's why our Conservative Government believes it's vitally important to help Canadians become homeowners,",706
"to help them maintain and increase the value of their homes,",706
and to make changes through renovations as their needs and circumstances evolve.,706
"Our plan for affordable, responsible homeownership is working.",305
Canada now has one of the highest homeownership rates in the world and exceeds that of the United States for the first time in decades.,305
Homeownership is a key way to support Canadian families.,706
And there's more we can do to help aspiring homeowners buy and invest in their homes.,706
"A re-elected Conservative Government will set a target to add more than 700,000 new homeowners by 2020.",706
"If this goal for affordable, responsible homeownership is reached, we'll see the number of Canadian homeowners exceed 10 million.",706
The Home Buyers' Plan allows aspiring homeowners to make tax-free withdrawals from their Registered Retirement Savings Plans to finance the purchase or new construction of their first home.,706
"In 2009, our Conservative Government increased the allowable withdrawal from $20,000 to $25,000 the first increase since the program was established a generation earlier.",706
"This has become an important method of financing for first-time homeowners, benefiting almost 200,000 Canadians a year.",706
"A re-elected Conservative Government will raise the Home Buyers' Plan limit once again, from $25,000 to $35,000.",706
With this increase we will continue to help families achieve the pride and stability of having a place to call their own.,706
"The Home Renovation Tax Credit, originally established by our Government in 2009 as a temporary measure, was a resounding success.",305
"About one in every three households took advantage of this program, saving more than three million Canadians, on average, more than $700 each.",305
"It also pumped $4.3 billion into our national economy, in tough economic times.",305
"It was such a success story so good for Canadian families, and so good for the Canadian economy that a re-elected Conservative Government will enact a new permanent Home Renovation Tax Credit, available each year for substantial home renovation expenses up to $2,500, beginning in January 2017, and $5,000, beginning in January 2019.",504
"Given the importance of homeownership, our Government wants to make sure it remains a dream within reach for the average Canadian family.",706
"Some reports have suggested that speculative foreign non-resident buyers are a significant factor in driving homes out of the price range of average families, especially in Vancouver and Toronto.",403
"If speculators are driving up the cost of housing to unaffordable levels, that's something the government can and should address.",403
"Other countries, like Australia, have put in place regulations that limit the ability of foreign buyers to purchase existing houses for investment purposes.",403
"A re-elected Conservative Government will compile comprehensive data on the acquisition of Canadian real estate by foreign non-residents and temporary residents,",403
"and, if this is contributing to putting the dream of homeownership out of reach of Canadians, we'll work in coordination with provincial governments to take the appropriate action.",301
SAVING FOR A CHILD'S EDUCATION,NA
Part of ensuring Canadian children get the best possible start in life is helping their parents begin saving for their future education.,506
"Our Conservative Government has a solid record of making it easier for families to save and prepare for their children's education,",305
"including providing tax relief on scholarships and bursaries,",506
and targeting student grants to low- and middle-income students.,506
One of the ways we've helped families is through Registered Education Savings Plans.,506
These plans allow Canadians to invest money tax-free until it's time to pay that first tuition bill.,506
"Because we realize how important this is, our Conservative Government has contributed significantly to Canadian families' RESPs, through matching grants.",506
"In 2014, we helped 2.59 million children invest in their future, including 900,000 children from low- and middle-income families who received enhanced, targeted grants.",506
But we want to help even more.,506
A re-elected Conservative Government will:   Double the enhanced grant for middle-income families from 10 cents to 20 cents per dollar on the first $500 contributed each year.,506
Double the enhanced grant for lower-income families from 20 cents to 40 cents per dollar on the first $500 contributed each year.,506
"$2,200 more per student or roughly a half year's tuition costs in additional government support, assuming a reasonable rate of return.",506
"This new commitment builds on policies in our Economic Action Plan 2015 that will make life easier and more affordable for post-secondary students and their families including:   Eliminating in-study income from the Canada Student Loans Program assessment so that students can work, earn money, and gain valuable experience while studying without affecting their loan eligibility helping 87,000 students per year.",506
"Reducing the expected parental contributions from the Canada Student Loans Program assessment to better recognize the financial realities faced by Canadian families increasing support to approximately 92,000 students.",506
"Expanding the number of low- and middle-income students eligible for the Canada Student Grant program by making these grants applicable to short-term, vocational programs.",506
SAVING FOR A SECURE RETIREMENT,NA
"Canadians know the value of saving, whether it's for a car, for college or university, for a family vacation, or just for a rainy day.",706
"And we believe in encouraging Canadians to save, which is why we've expanded significantly their ability to do so.",706
"No two families are exactly alike, and imposing a one-size-fits-all approach to saving would be wrong for Canada and wrong for Canadians.",706
"Instead, we're making it easier for Canadians to save money in whatever way works best for them and their families.",706
"We want all Canadians to be able to dream big, knowing their hard-earned money will be there for them when they need it.",706
Saving for retirement is major priority for Canadians.,706
That's why our Conservative Government has consistently lowered taxes to leave Canadians with more take-home pay and expanded the range of voluntary options for them to save for their future.,706
Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) have become the single most important personal savings vehicle in decades.,706
Nearly 11 million Canadians have opened an account and the total value of assets held is about $120 billion.,706
"Low- and middle-income Canadians have have benefited significantly about half of TFSA holders earned less than $42,000.",706
Put simply: TFSAs have become a place where almost one in three Canadians keep and grow their dreams.,706
"A re-elected Conservative Government will protect the TFSA and the recent doubling of the annual contribution limit to $10,000 per year.",402
We'll also take further steps to help Canadians save for retirement and to lower taxes on Canadian seniors by:   Giving seniors significantly greater flexibility in managing their retirement income by reducing the minimum withdrawal requirements for Registered Retirement Income Funds.,504
"Raising the Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption from $500,000 to 750,000 to $800,000 and indexing it.",504
We'll raise it to $1 million for farmers and fishermen to help them with succession planning and their retirement.,703
Consulting with Canadians on how to supplement the range of savings options with voluntary Canada Pension Plan contributions.,504
TAX RELIEF FOR SINGLE AND WIDOWED SENIORS,NA
"Canadian seniors have earned our gratitude for a lifetime of hard work in service to our families, our communities, and our country.",706
"They have helped make Canada the strong and prosperous country that it is today,",706
and they deserve to enjoy their senior years in dignity and financial security.,504
"Our Conservative Government has cut taxes and is making life more affordable for Canadian seniors, including single and widowed seniors.",504
"We've:   Introduced Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), which 2.7 million Canadian have now opened.",402
"Income earned and withdrawals from TFSAs don't affect eligibility for the Age Credit, Old Age Security, and the Guaranteed Income Supplement.",504
"Enhanced the TFSA in 2015 to allow Canadians to contribute up to $10,000 each year, with seniors to receive 60 percent of the benefits from this new contribution limit.",504
"Enacted Pension Income Splitting for seniors to benefit more than 2.2 million Canadian seniors each year, with average federal tax relief of $900 annually.",504
Improved the rules for Registered Retirement Income Funds to allow seniors to preserve more of their retirement savings.,504
"Increased the Age Credit amount by $2,000, to provide up to $1,055 in annual tax relief for seniors.",504
Announced the biggest increases in a generation to the Guaranteed Income Supplement to help Canada's most vulnerable seniors.,504
"Doubled, to $2,000, the maximum amount of income eligible for the Pension Income Credit.",504
"Created, in 2015, a new, permanent Home Accessibility Tax Credit for seniors that provides up to $1,500 in tax relief each year.",504
"The results of our low-tax, balanced budget plan for Canada's seniors are clear.",305
"Since 2006, we have cut taxes on Canadian seniors by $3 billion each and every year.",504
"Almost 400,000 seniors have been removed from the tax rolls completely.",504
"And now a single senior can earn at least $20,360 and a senior couple at least $40,720 before paying any federal income tax.",504
Yet single and widowed seniors are among Canada's most vulnerable citizens and face unique financial challenges.,706
The cost of living can be high for single seniors living on a fixed income.,706
"And when a senior becomes widowed, he or she can lose access to some benefits their spouse received and can face difficult financial circumstances as a result.",706
"In response, a re-elected Conservative Government will establish an equivalent-to-spouse€ Pension Income Credit for single and widowed seniors.",706
"This $2,000 Single Seniors Tax Credit will extend tax relief to nearly 1.6 million single and widowed seniors.",706
"Through this new tax relief, our Conservative Government is making an affordable, targeted commitment to Canada's single seniors, who deserve our respect and financial support.",706
HELP FOR CANADIANS WITH DISABILITIES,NA
The moms and dads who care for a child with a disability make incredible sacrifices and carry tremendous workloads in the name of love.,705
"For these families, making sure a loved one with a disability is financially secure is a real concern.",705
We have a responsibility to help ensure that their kids lead lives as fulfilling as any other Canadian.,705
"That's why, in 2008, thanks to the vision of the late Jim Flaherty, our Conservative Government established Registered Disability Savings Plans.",705
"These plans allow the families of children with disabilities, and those children themselves as they grow up, to set aside money for the future in a place where it can grow with them, tax-free, until it's needed.",705
"Canadians have opened nearly 105,000 of these accounts since then and through the Canada Disability Savings Grant and the Canada Disability Savings Bond programs, we've added more than $1 billion to their savings.",705
But we can do more.,705
"A re-elected Conservative Government will increase the maximum annual grant for low- and middle-income families from $3,500 to $4,000.",504
"This means that these families will now receive a matching grant of $4 for every $1 contributed, on the first $500 they contribute each year.",504
"We'll also continue to work with the provinces and Canada's financial institutions to improve the administration of the RDSP program,",303
and to expand the range of investment options for RDSP holders.,504
"We'll take these additional steps because when your loved one's future is financially secure, you're better able to focus on the important things that matter in the present.",705
This measure builds on our record of helping Canadians with disabilities fulfill their potential.,705
A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to support our three-year partnership with the Canadian Association of Community Living to help connect people with developmental disabilities with jobs.,705
We'll also continue our four-year partnership with the Sinneave Family Foundation and Autism Speaks Canada to expand vocational training programs for people with Autism Spectrum Disorder.,411
And we'll continue to support the Autism Spectrum Disorder Working Group's work to develop a Canadian Autism Partnership.,705
We'll be ready to support the initiative in areas of federal jurisdiction once the development work is complete.,705
SUPPORTING EVERY FAMILY,NA
Families come in different shapes and sizes and have different needs.,706
Our Conservative Government has consistently supported all families we think that's real fairness.,706
This support includes adoptive families.,706
"About 3,000 children are adopted in Canada every year but, at any given time, there are about 30,000 children within this country alone in need of stable homes filled with love,",706
and thousands of Canadian families waiting to invite them into their hearts and lives.,706
We recognize that adoption costs can be high and in some cases prohibitive for families.,706
That's why we've:   Expanded the Adoption Expense Tax Credit.,504
Extended EI parental benefits to foster parents who choose to adopt.,504
Cut backlogs and wait times for adopted children as part of our immigration reforms.,303
We'll continue to support adoptive families in giving children a loving home.,504
"A re-elected Conservative Government will increase our support for these caring Canadians, by increasing the amount eligible for the Adoption Expense Tax Credit from $15,000 to $20,000 per child,",504
and by making this tax credit fully refundable.,504
"The birth of a new baby is an exciting time for all involved, especially moms and dads.",706
It's also a period of tremendous change for parents as they adjust their work and home lives to the new responsibilities of parenthood.,706
Our Conservative Government wants to support parents during this critically important period.,504
Increasing job flexibility is one way to support moms and dads who want to spend as much time as possible with their babies as they grow and take their first steps.,504
Some parents also see the transition to parenthood as a good time to pursue their entrepreneurial instincts.,504
That's why a re-elected Conservative Government will:   Expand Employment Insurance maternity and parental benefits and federal leave provisions to increase flexibility for new parents and encourage those with self-employment goals.,504
"New parents in federally regulated sectors will be provided with job protection to care for a baby up to 18 months of age, allowing workers to take up to 6 months of additional unpaid leave.",504
"Parents can opt to receive their EI parental benefits at the full rate for up to 35 weeks,",504
or they can extend those payments at a lesser rate up to a maximum of 61 weeks.,504
"When combined with other EI maternity leave, this can provide parents with a stream of income for 18 months while caring for their babies.",504
"A new two-year pilot project will be established to allow parents to earn self-employment income, without impacting EI maternity or parental benefits, up to 100% of the weekly EI maximum insurable earnings threshold.",504
Women receiving EI maternity benefits will also be able to earn employment income under the Working While on Claim pilot project.,504
This is currently permitted for those receiving EI parental benefits.,504
We'll also continue to support choice in childcare and help families make whatever arrangements are right for them.,706
This is the underlying basis for our monthly Universal Child Care Benefit,504
and our other support for childcare including the Child Care Expense Deduction.,504
"A re-elected Conservative Government will implement our plan to increase the Child Care Expense Deduction by $1,000, beginning this year.",504
"This means that the maximum amount that can be claimed will increase to $8,000 from $7,000 for children under age seven, to $5,000 from $4,000 for children aged seven through 16, and to $11,000 from $10,000 for children with disabilities.",504
"And, of course, we'll continue to maintain our Universal Child Care Benefit that provides monthly cheques to all parents, up to nearly $2,000 per year for children under age 6, and more than $700 per year for children aged 6 to 17.",504
Families help each other.,706
Sometimes Canadians are called upon to care for a gravely ill family member.,706
"Such situations can be challenging financially, and no one should ever have to choose between caring for a loved one and keeping their job.",706
Our Conservative Government has taken several steps to help families faced with a family health crisis such as enacting the Family Caregiver Tax Credit,504
and establishing a special 35-week benefit for parents with critically ill children.,504
But there is more to be done.,504
"When a family member is gravely ill and needs care, Canadians should be free to focus on caring for their loved ones without the added stress of worrying about their financial security.",504
A re-elected Conservative Government will carry out our plan to extend the Employment Insurance Compassionate Care Benefits period from six weeks to six months.,504
PROTECTING CONSUMERS,NA
"Canadians work hard for their money and rightly expect, as consumers, to be treated fairly when it comes to matters of quality, safety and choice.",403
We're committed to ensuring that they are.,403
"A re-elected Conservative Government will proceed with several measures to protect consumers' wallets, and their health and safety.",403
"We'll:   Pass legislation that allows the Minister of Transport to issue motor-vehicle recalls and to demand that manufacturers repair defective vehicles as required,",403
as well as levy significant fines on manufacturers and importers who do not comply.,403
"Continue to take action to create greater consumer choice in the wireless sector, so that Canadians can enjoy lower prices and improved quality when it comes to cellphones, tablets, and wi-fi services.",403
"Pass legislation to grant the federal Competition Commissioner the authority to investigate geographic differences in prices, with the intent of reducing the price gap€ between Canadian and American consumer goods.",403
Move forward with comprehensive legislation to protect consumers in financial transactions.,403
"This will include banning pay to pay€ practices, in which financial institutions charge their customers a fee for making payments on their mortgages, credit cards, or other loans.",403
Continue our efforts to assess and manage the risks posed to the health of Canadian families and our environment by new or existing chemical substances.,501
"This will include listing microbeads as a toxic substance under the Environmental Protection Act, effectively banning them in Canada.",501
"Our Government in 2014 passed Vanessa's Law, named after the daughter of Member of Parliament Terence Young.",403
"Vanessa died of a heart attack while taking a prescription drug that was later found to be unsafe for human consumption,",403
and Terence spent the next 14 years working tirelessly to ensure that this law became his daughter's legacy.,403
"Vanessa's Law is historic legislation that gives the Government stronger powers to force drug recalls,",403
"imposes new penalties on companies that market unsafe products,",403
"requires that health risks be made clear in product labelling,",403
and requires health-care institutions to report serious reactions to prescription drugs.,403
"Still, Vanessa's Law could go further.",403
"For example, we should impose on health-care institutions a more comprehensive, standardized reporting regime when documenting such reactions.",303
A re-elected Conservative Government will move forward with making this important legislation even more effective at protecting Canadian families.,303
"These measures build on our past record of standing up for consumers, including:   Supporting Canada's broadcast regulator in compelling satellite and cable companies to unbundle€ TV channels, so that Canadians no longer have to pay for channels they don't want.",403
Removing the GST from feminine hygiene products.,503
And continuing to oppose any new Netflix tax€ on on-demand video services.,403
AT RISK,NA
Our Conservative Government has worked hard to make life easier for Canadians.,305
Taxes are lower.,305
Benefits are higher.,305
And Canadian families have more freedom than ever before to choose their own path to prosperity.,706
"We know that no two families are alike, but all families have this in common: Given the opportunity, they'll make the choices that are right for them.",706
"The other parties don't share our optimism, nor our faith in the sound instincts and common sense of our fellow Canadians.",305
"Given the chance, the Liberals and NDP would put the financial security of Canadian families in jeopardy by:   Running large deficits and raising taxes that will leave our fragile economy exposed,",305
"cost families money,",305
and put jobs at risk.,305
"Eliminating the Family Tax Cut which is providing up to $2,000 in tax relief for 1.7 million families.",305
"Taking away the monthly Universal Child-Care Benefit which is providing nearly $2,000 per year for children under age 6, and more than $700 per year for children aged 6 to 17.",305
The UCCB goes to all the nearly four million families with children.,305
Shutting down in part or in whole Tax-Free Savings Accounts which are helping 11 million Canadians save and grow their savings tax-free.,305
Cancelling Pension Income Splitting which is providing over $1 billion in tax relief to more than 1 million senior couples.,305
"Hiking payroll taxes as much as $1,000 per year for someone making $60,000 on Canadian workers.",305
"Driving up the price of everything Canadian families buy, including gasoline, groceries, and home heating fuel, by imposing carbon pricing schemes on the Canadian economy.",305
OUR CONSERVATIVE PLAN FOR A MORE SECURE CANADA,NA
"To keep Canadians safe and secure, a re-elected Conservative Government will:   Enact Declared Areas€ legislation to prosecute foreign fighters",605
Continue to participate in the broad international coalition against ISIS,104
Support persecuted religious minorities around the world,107
Defend Canada's Northern sovereignty,109
Expand Canada's Reserves and Special Operations Forces,104
Our Conservative Government understands that protecting Canadians' physical security is as important as protecting their financial security.,605
The two ultimately go hand-in-hand.,605
We can't have a strong economy if Canadian communities aren't safe and secure.,605
And we can't have real security if we don't have the means to pay for our law enforcement agencies or our military.,410
"A strong economy, then, is the basis for our prosperity and our security.",410
We'll continue to vigorously pursue an anti-terrorism agenda that seeks to disrupt and undermine radical jihadism in cooperation with the countries who share our values.,605
"In addition to Canada's military participation in the global coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS,",104
we are taking strong action against terrorism at home.,605
We'll also continue to follow a principled foreign policy and stand up for what's right rather than what's popular.,109
"In a dangerous and unstable world, we need a government that recognizes risks to Canadian interests and our security and speaks with clarity.",109
And we've done that.,305
Prime Minister Stephen Harper has been a leader on a wide range of global issues,305
"including standing up for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression,",101
"defending Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state and to defend itself,",101
and speaking out against the persecution of religious minorities and women and girls around the world.,201
And it's why we've ensured that the Canadian Armed Forces have the equipment and resources they need to protect and defend our security.,104
We've made significant investments in Canada's military,104
following the Liberal Decade of Darkness€.,305
"We owe the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces our unyielding gratitude and respect,",104
and we'll continue to make sure that they have the resources to get the job done.,104
A re-elected Conservative Government will continue its efforts to protect the security of Canada and Canadians at home and abroad.,605
COMBATING JIHADI TERRORISM,NA
"Canada and Canadians not just abroad, but at home, that is when we most need moral clarity and tough leadership.",605
We need to confront and address this threat and call it what it is a force for evil that seeks to undermine our way of life and the values we hold dear.,605
This clarity and determination to act to protect our country has been at the heart of our counter-terrorism measures here at home.,605
"Our Conservative Government released Canada's first Counter-terrorism Strategy in 2012, Building Resilience Against Terrorism, designed to counter domestic and international terrorism and protect Canadians and Canadian interests.",605
"In 2013, the Combating Terrorism Act made it a criminal offence to leave or attempt to leave Canada for the purposes of participating in or facilitating terrorist activity.",605
"In 2014, the Citizenship Act was amended to enable the government to revoke Canadian citizenship from dual citizens and deny it to permanent residents who are convicted of terrorism, high treason, treason or spying offences.",605
The Protection of Canada from Terrorists Act of 2015 gives the Canadian Security Intelligence Service the tools it needs to investigate threats to the security of Canada and ensure our collective safety.,605
"The 2015 Anti-terrorism Act ensures that Canadian law enforcement and national security agencies can effectively investigate and counter those who promote terrorism and take part in terrorist activities,",605
"prevent terrorist travel by air and the efforts of those who seek to use Canada as a recruiting ground,",605
and disrupt planned attacks on Canadian soil.,605
"Sadly and inexplicably, to most Canadians a small number of young Canadians choose to turn their backs on our country, our values, and all the opportunities that living here brings, and travel abroad to connect with known terrorist organizations.",605
Some participate in the atrocities these groups carry out in foreign lands;,605
others seek to plot and commit similar horrors on Canadian soil.,605
Canadians expect real action on the part of the government to prevent such attacks.,605
"We need to protect Canadians here by making sure the foreign fighters€ who travel to parts of the world where terrorists hold sway are not allowed, on their return to Canada, to act on the warped ideologies and deadly skills they've learned.",605
"A re-elected Conservative Government will introduce Declared Areas€ legislation, allowing the Minister of Foreign Affairs to identify any part of the world where terrorists are active as a no-go€ zone for Canadians without legitimate business there.",605
"Travel to designated zones would become a serious offence, carrying a significant prison term,",605
and would allow Canadian authorities to arrest and detain foreign fighters upon their attempted return to Canada.,605
"To counter terrorism and youth radicalization in Canada through research and education, our Government launched the Kanishka Project in 2011.",605
Funded projects identify factors that build community resilience and help youth to resist violent extremism.,605
A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to address the growing problem of terrorist radicalization and violent extremism among Canadian youth by renewing funding for the Kanishka Project for another five years.,605
"Treason, one of the oldest and most serious crimes on the books, has evolved since it was first codified into English law in the 14th century.",605
"Originally an attack against the reigning monarch, it came to encompass turning against one's own state.",605
"Now, in the 21st century we are witnessing the alarming emergence of a new form of treason.",605
Foreign fighters€ who are mostly young men, including some Canadians
"Canadians see this as a betrayal of our most deeply held values and, indeed, as an attack on all of us.",601
"There is no greater crime than the betrayal of one's fellow citizens, and our laws need to reflect this.",601
Our current laws call for life in prison for anyone convicted of High Treason.,605
A re-elected Conservative Government will modernize the definition of High Treason to include fighting against the Canadian Armed Forces alongside jihadist terror groups.,605
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS,NA
The so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS is the greatest threat to Canadian security today.,104
"It wages war daily on everything we hold dear: freedom, democracy, tolerance, and openness.",104
"It seeks to destroy any and all who do not share its perverse, medieval view of the world.",104
"And, with alarming clarity, it has threatened Canadians directly and specifically.",104
"Last year's terrorist attacks in Canada, by killers inspired by ISIS's extremism, are a reminder that we are not immune to these threats.",104
"Canadians did not invent this evil, nor did we invite its hatred, but we cannot ignore it in the hope it goes away.",104
"Indeed, it was because ISIS met with little resistance at first that it was able to establish its so-called caliphate with such alarming speed.",104
"It's now using that territory to launch and inspire attacks around the world; its goal is to replace civilization with savagery, and order with chaos.",104
We must not allow ISIS to hold a safe haven from which it can pursue an agenda of anarchy and violence.,104
"That's why the Canadian Armed Forces, alongside like-minded allies of all faiths and nationalities, are part of a broad international coalition confronting and disrupting ISIS in the Middle East right now.",104
We're fighting the jihadists there to protect Canadians here.,104
"We're also a leading contributor of support to the countless men, women, and children forced to flee ISIS's advance.",104
"We don't have to choose, as some have suggested, between fighting the soldiers of ISIS and helping its victims.",104
"In fact, it's imperative that we do both.",104
And we are.,104
"A re-elected Conservative Government will not cut and run, as our opponents would do.",104
We will not abandon our allies in the broad international coalition against ISIS.,104
We will not pull our troops from the fight against jihadi terrorism.,104
PROTECTING PERSECUTED MINORITIES AROUND THE WORLD,NA
"Our Conservative Government has consistently stood up for, and supported, persecuted minorities around the world.",107
We've made a real difference in the lives of religious minorities and young girls and women.,107
And we've shown leadership in accepting refugees and providing humanitarian assistance.,107
This is an important part of our principled foreign policy.,107
A re-elected Conservative Government will continue to stand up for those who are targeted because of their faith or gender.,107
"Freedom of religion and belief, and the ability to express that freedom without fear of repercussion or repression, is a basic human right not just here in Canada, but everywhere.",107
"Our Government established the Office of Religious Freedom in 2013 to promote this belief globally,",107
and to advocate tolerance and pluralism around the world.,107
"These values have made Canada great,",601
and our Government takes very seriously the work of advancing them.,601
"However, a world of universal freedom of religion remains elusive, and there is much work left to do.",201
Almost 75 percent of the world's population lives in countries where religious freedom is highly restricted.,201
"Currently, ISIS has carved out a so-called caliphate extending from Aleppo in Syria to near Baghdad in Iraq and everywhere they hold sway, innocent men, women and children suffer atrocities daily because they don't share the terrorists' perverted version of Islam.",107
"Christians, Yazidis, Druze, Alawites, Sunni Bedouins and Shia Ismailis all face subjugation, persecution, and, frequently, grisly execution for their beliefs.",107
"Through the Office of Religious Freedom, in partnership with civil society groups and non-governmental organizations, we are able to stand up for these oppressed peoples, and for Canadian values.",107
Principle demands that we act.,107
"A re-elected Conservative Government will build on our record of promoting tolerance and openness, as well as the rights of women and children worldwide, by funding a new three-year program within the Office of Religious Freedom to support persecuted religious minorities in the Middle East,",107
and to protect their places of worship and priceless artifacts at risk of destruction.,107
"The ISIS reign of terror and the horrific civil war being fought in Syria have taken an immense toll on innocent civilians, creating a refugee crisis of historic proportions.",107
"The Canadian Armed Forces are taking an active and robust role in the fight against ISIS,",104
but we're also committed to providing comfort and aid to suffering people facing displacement and persecution because of the ongoing violence.,107
"Canada has long been a refuge for people fleeing violence and oppression, from United Empire Loyalists and fugitive slaves from the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, to Eastern Europeans and Vietnamese boat people€ fleeing communism in the 20th.",201
"And in the 21st century, Canada is once again opening its doors to those in need.",201
"We've pledged to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees by September 2016, and 3,000 Iraqis this year.",107
"They will join the 20,000 Iraqis who have already arrived on our shores since 2009.",107
"Religious minorities within Iraq are at risk of genocide at the hands of ISIS,",107
and Canada will provide safe haven.,107
"A re-elected Conservative Government will accept 10,000 more persecuted Syrian and Iraqi refugees fleeing the brutality of ISIS.",107
We'll also provide further humanitarian assistance through the Syria Emergency Relief Fund to match individual donations from Canadians up to $100 million.,107
"Every year, millions of girls around the world some as young as five years old are forced into marriage.",706
This is far more than just a moral outrage; it is often a matter of life and death.,706
"In the developing world, the leading cause of death among girls between the ages of 15 and 19 is complications during childbirth.",706
"Forced marriage deprives girls of their right to an education,",706
and condemns them to a life of poverty and dependence.,706
And forced marriage is also a weapon of war.,201
"Canadians are rightly appalled at reports of ISIS fighters taking young female prisoners as brides,€",201
or forcing families to let them marry their daughters in exchange for protection from further ISIS depravities.,201
"Canada has been a leader in improving maternal, newborn and child health,",107
and protecting women and girls is a key component of our foreign development goals.,107
"It's also in keeping with Canadian values, which we hold to be universal.",201
"Forced marriage is unacceptable in Canada,",201
and we've taken action to prevent it from occurring on our soil.,201
"But it's equally unacceptable anywhere else in the world, no matter what the misguided advocates of cultural sensitivity€ might suggest.",201
"A re-elected Conservative Government will take further action to support the victims of child, early, and forced marriage, particularly in the rape camps€ and slave markets of Iraq and Syria,",107
"by establishing a new program within the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development to fund efforts to combat these practices.",107
"Improving the health of mothers, newborns, and children around the world has been Stephen Harper's top development priority.",107
The Prime Minister has been leading the world on this important initiative.,305
"And there's been progress: thanks to Canadian leadership and global action, maternal mortality rates are declining and millions more children are celebrating their fifth birthday.",107
Yet there's more work to be done.,107
"That's why our Government has pledged significant resources to maternal, newborn, and child health from 2015 to 2020.",107
We'll continue to rally world leaders to follow Canada's lead in improving women's and children's health in developing countries.,107
CYBER SECURITY,NA
"Advances in technology have led to vast improvements in our standard of living,",411
but they have also led to our greater dependence on a digital infrastructure that underlies everything from our communications networks to our financial systems to our electrical grid.,411
"And this dependence makes us vulnerable to attacks that could compromise our day-to day living, our personal safety, our economy, and even our national security.",605
The threat of cybercrime is one with serious consequences for Canadians and our economy.,605
Our Conservative Government has been focused on strengthening our cyber security to protect Canadians.,605
"Since 2010, our national cyber security strategy has been based on three pillars:   Securing government systems.",605
Partnering to secure vital cyber systems outside the federal government,605
And helping individual Canadians and their families enjoy increased online security.,605
"In Economic Action Plan 2015, we announced significant funding to protect our vital cyber systems, including establishing a dedicated RCMP team to investigate cybercrime.",605
"Still, there's more to be done.",605
Our cyber systems can be targets for foreign military and intelligence services and criminal and terrorist networks.,605
"As more and more Canadians rely on the internet for business and sales, we must ensure that we're protected from cyber-attacks and cybercrimes.",605
"We've proposed legislation that will require operators of vital cyber systems to implement robust cybersecurity plans that meet established standards,",605
and to report cybersecurity breaches to the federal government.,605
A re-elected Conservative Government will enshrine this in law by passing the Protection of Canada's Vital Cyber Systems Act when Parliament resumes.,605
SUPPORTING UKRAINE,NA
"Canada stands in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, and will continue to do so.",101
"Our position has been clear: We will never accept Russian President Vladimir Putin's unwarranted and illegal occupation and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula,",101
nor his continued proxy war in other parts of eastern Ukraine.,101
"The people of Ukraine have left no room for doubt: The future they desire lies to the West, with all the freedoms, opportunities and prosperity that brings.",101
"We, along with our allies in NATO, support them without reservation,",101
and we stand together in Central and Eastern Europe as a bulwark against the instability Vladimir Putin promotes with his reckless provocations.,101
"With the rest of the Western world, Canadians celebrated the end of the Cold War and the years of peace that followed.",106
"But Vladimir Putin wants to turn back the clock; he wants Russia to bask in the perceived glories of its past, in order to disguise his failures of leadership in the present.",106
We look forward to the day when Russia returns to the community of nations €“,106
"but until then, Vladimir Putin's belligerence must be met with resolve and real consequences.",106
"Under our Conservative Government, Canada has been a leading voice on the world stage in this regard, both in speaking out against Vladimir Putin's unprovoked aggression and in putting pressure on Russia through tough and meaningful sanctions.",106
"Such sanctions are a key tool in our Government's foreign policy, having proven effective against Iran and North Korea, as well as Russia.",106
A re-elected Conservative Government will toughen Canada's sanctions regime by:   Adding gross human rights violations€ as a new ground for sanctions.,106
And closing loopholes that allow sanctioned individuals to circumvent travel restrictions.,106
