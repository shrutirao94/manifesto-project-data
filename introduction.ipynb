    "Time to get started with computational text analysis! Along the way, we will learn about applications of machine learning and natural language processing  more broadly. Like other methods, these methods are best learned by doing. So let's work through some examples. Today we are going to focus mostly on processing text at the *beginning* of a text analysis workflow. We will go from unstructured text > processed text > bag of words > feature matrix for training machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll begin with a brief overview of how computational text analysis relates to other methods of content analysis -- quantitative and qualitative -- with long histories in the social sciences. Then, we will get into the specifics of computational text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please create more cells (or add to this one) for your notes as I lecture. Once we are sufficiently on the same page about the high-level overview, we will start working through specific examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few classes, we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- TODAY: processing text  \n",
    "  - tokenization, cleaning, stemming, lemmatization, bag of words / vector space model\n",
    "  - computing IF-IDF weights\n",
    "  - part of speech tagging\n",
    "- NEXT CLASS: three different types of unsupervised methods\n",
    "  - $k$-means clustering of documents based on cosine similarity\n",
    "  - LDA topic model\n",
    "  - topic detection in semantic networks\n",
    "- NEXT CLASS: one supervised method\n",
    "  - Naïve Bayes\n",
    "  - a framework for integrating both unsupervised and supervised methods in the same text analysis project\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by reading through the flowchart below. I created it to help you get a high-level overview of the process(es) of computational text analysis, from unstructured text, to numbers, to (validated) models, to enlightenment. Or at least reasonable conclusions...\n",

    "![](img/text_theory.png)\n",

    "It is not possible to do high-quality computational text analysis without initial text processing. To illustrate some basic concepts, we will start with a very small text dataset: political party manifestos from the 2015 Canadian federal election. I've downloaded the data for the Liberals, Conservatives, New Democrats, and Greens from the [Manifesto Project](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu). You can easily obtain data for other years, countries, and parties.\n",

    "Much better! Still, we could benefit from [stemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) or [lemmatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation). Stemming reduces words to their stem, while lemmatization groups words together into their most basic dictionary form. Depending on your case, stemming or lemmatization will allow you to group together related words that have different surface forms (e.g. 'run,' 'running', and 'runners', or 'sick' and 'ill'). This will improve the quality of any models we train.\n",

The tradeoff is that stems are faster to compute and the validity ends up being comparable to lemmatization. Both methods have been shown to work very well for computational text analysis. Unless you have a good reason not to (e.g. variations on a word carry a lot of meaning in your particular case), then you should just pick one.\n",

    "\n",
    "If we wanted to, we could now transform our bag of words into a document-term feature matrix. In this matrix, each document in our analysis (currently only 4!) would be a row, and every feature would be a column. In this and other computational text analyses, the features are unique words from the corpus. If we were to continue with this toy example, how many features would there be in our matrix? However many unique tokens there are in our entire corpus! If there are 1 million tokens, then our matrix would have 1 million features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless we compute some statistic, the cells in our matrix will just be raw counts of the number of times a given token is in a given document. For example, if the token \"education\" appears in a document 'liberal' 6 times, then that cell in the matrix will be 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of matrix is very common, and very useful. The basic idea, as you might have guessed, is that words that appear more frequently in a document are more important to that document. However, some words (like \"canada\" or \"government\") are common but not especially meaningful because they appear frequently across all documents. Instead of raw counts, we may want the cells of our matrix to be some sort of weight that better measures how important that word is to the document. That's where TF-IDF comes in.\n",

    "# Measuring Word Importance with TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing you may have noticed in the bags of words above is that some words (e.g. \"canada\", 'government') are so common across the documents in our corpus that they don't help us understand important differences in what is talked about in each document. For the same reasons that we removed stop words, we may want to pay less attention to words that are very common across documents in our corpus, and pay more attention to words that appear frequently within documents and less frequently across the corpus. That's what [term frequency - inverse document frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf–idf), or TF-IDF, is for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tf-idf statistic measures the importance of a word in a document in a larger corpus. Formally, it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- $$w_i,_j = tf_i,_j * log\\Big(\\frac{N}{df_i}\\Big)$$ -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the tf-idf weight $w$ for word $i$ in document $j$ is equal to the term frequency multiplied by the inverse document frequency. Clear as mud?\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- The term frequency $tf_i,_j$ is just the number of times the word $i$ appears in document $j$. The inverse document frequency the log of the total number of documents in the corpus divided by the number of documents that the word $i$ appears in. TF-IDF is just the product of those two numbers. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF can be computed easily using Python packages like [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/). Let's take a look at both using a more serious example instead of this toy example. We will do so in another notebook ('unsupervised.ipynb').\n",
